    "text": "ReadingsSoftwareTrainingHelp\n\n\n\nTextbooks\nThe course does not strictly follow the content of a textbook, but the expectation is that students will read as much as possible of the assigned chapters from the following books:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020. Regression and other stories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ROS\n\n\nFree to download PDF version from the book’s website: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman and Hall/CRC  TSD\n\n\nFree online book: https://tellingstorieswithdata.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., and Hill, J. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ARM\n\n\nNote: ROS is the expanded and updated version of Part 1 (and some of Part 3) of this book. While everyone in the free world eagerly awaits the publication of ROS’s multilevel counterpart, we’ll use ARM as a reference work for the theory underpinning multilevel modelling.  Not freely available. Access it in print or online via the NU library\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week from these books, referring to them by their acronyms. Don’t worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week! Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.\n\n\nApplication\nIn the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week’s outline (still work in progress!).\nThe articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.\nWhen selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don’t take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!\n\n\nTechnique\nThere will also be various readings relating more closely to the technicalities of coding in R and scientific writing, collaboration and communication in general. These readings will also be listed under each week’s outline as the semester progresses. The generic reading that students are advised to go through on their own is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science (2nd ed.)  R4DS\n\n\nFree online book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition\nFinally, there will also be recommended readings listed under certain weeks that help place methods, statistics and probability theory in a broader frame. These are useful readings for everyone, regardless of whether you will be applying quantitative analysis in your research or future work.\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\nWe will use a number of open-source software for data analysis and scientific writing. You need to install these on your personal computers to be able to work away from campus:\n\n\n\n\nR\n(programming language)\nEssential\nR needs to be installed even if we will only use it via the RStudio interface.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nRStudio\n(integrated development environment)\nEssential\nYou will need the free desktop version appropriate for your operating system. RStudio combines the R Console - the direct interface to R - with a number of other panels.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nTidyverse\n(collection of R packages)\nEssential\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages that make the R language easier to use by introducing a more consistent grammar. It provides functions that are particularly useful for data manipulation and visualisation. It is the most common ‘dialect’ used among social scientists.\nInstall from within RStudio by executing in the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nQuarto\n(scientific publishing system)\nEssential\nWe will be using Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) throughout the course to document our data analysis. .qmd files extend the plain-text Markdown mark-up language (.md) to allow for data analysis code to be executed and results presented alongside the main text. This is an essential requirement for analytical transparency, reliability and reproducibility.The assignment will also be completed in .qmd.\nIncluded by default in the latest RStudio release; no need to install separately.\nYou can check your installation by executing in the RStudio Terminal :\nquarto check\n\n\n\nZotero\n(reference manager)\nRecommended\nIf you are not yet using a reference manager, I recommend giving Zotero a try. It will make your work much more efficient and it integrates (relatively well) with RMarkdown and Quarto using the the Better BibTeX add-on.\nInstall the latest version and add-ons from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with no previous experience using R and/or RStudio are advised to complete the self-paced free online training course R for Social Scientists provided by Data Carpentry at https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to get help with  outside class. If you encounter an error message or are looking for a function to perform a specific task that we have not covered in class, you can do a Google search; for best results, use the https://rseek.org/ search engine, which limits the results to those relating to the  language.\nYou can also search for answers on Stack Overflow, which is a popular help and discussion website for programmers. You can also post a question there, but make sure to follow community standards and advice on how to ask a good question and how to provide a minimal reproducible example. You will need some experience using the site before being able to ask a good question, but it’s more than certain that any question you have at this stage has already been asked and answered somewhere. Make sure you do a comprehensive search with various prompts before thinking about asking your question.\nIncreasingly, large language model-based chatbots such as the (in)famous ChatGPT can also provide good answers. You can use them efficiently, but make sure to always test out the responses, in the overwhelming majority of the cases the advice they give is unreliable, at least at first try."

    "text": "R and RStudio\nIf you are working on university desktops in the IT labs, recent versions of both R and RStudio will already be installed. To install them on your personal computers, follow the steps outlined here based on your operating system.\nAlthough you will likely only interact directly with RStudio, R needs to be installed first. Think of the relationship between the two as that between the engine of a car (R) and the dashboard of a car (RStudio); or, imagine driving this (R) versus this (RStudio).\nYour first task is to take RStudio for a spin and get to know some of its more commonly used panes. The four main panes are:\n\nThe R Console Pane\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R “engine”. This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to work with scripts and other text files. This pane is also where datasets (data frames) open up for viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote\nIf your RStudio displays only one pane on the left, it is because you have no scripts open yet. We can open an existing one or create a new one. We’ ll do that a bit later.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of “objects” that are available in an active session. Datasets loaded for analysis would appear here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote\nIf your Environment is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTip\nYou can arrange the panes in various ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.\n\n\nGeneral settings\nYou can personalise the look and feel of your RStudio setup in various ways using Tools &gt; Global Options from the top menu, but setting some options as default from the very start is highly recommended. You can see these in the pictures below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important setting in the picture on the left is the one to restore .RData at startup and saving the workspace as .RData on exit. Make sure these are un-ticked and set to ‘Never’, respectively, as shown in the picture. It’s always safer to start each RStudio session in a clean state, without anything automatically pre-loaded from a previos session. That could lead to serious and hard to trace complications.\nIn the picture on the right, you have the option to select that the new native pipe operator (we’ll talk about it later!) be inserted using the Ctrl+Shift+M keyboard shortcut instead of the older version of the pipe (|&gt;).\n\nThese settings will make more sense later, but it’s a good idea to have them sorted at the very beginning.",

    "section": "Task 1: Use R as a simple calculator",
    "text": "Task 1: Use R as a simple calculator\nThe most elementary yet still handy task you can use R for is to perform basic arithmetic operations. This is useful for getting a first experience doing things in the R language. Let’s have a look at a few operations using the Console directly. Let’s say we want to know the result of adding up three numbers: 1, 3 and 5. In the Console pane, type the command below and then click Enter:\n\n1 + 3 + 5\n\nThis will print out the result (9) in the Console:\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nThe [1] in the result is just the line number; in this case, our result only consists of a single line.\nWe can also save the result of this operation as an object, so we can use it for further operations. We create objects by using the so-called assignment operator consisting of the characters &lt;-. A command involving &lt;- can be read as “assign the value of the result from the operation on the right hand side (some expression) to the object on the left hand side (short name of object, single word, with no spaces)”. For example, let’s save our result in an object called “nine”:\n\nnine &lt;- 1 + 3 + 5\n\nNotice that there is no output printed in the Console this time. But there are also no error messages, so the operation must have run without problems. Instead, if we look at the Environment pane, we notice that it is no longer empty, but contains an object called “nine” that stores the value “9” in it. We can now use this object for other operations, such as:\n\nnine - 3\n\n[1] 6\n\nnine + 15\n\n[1] 24\n\nnine / 3\n\n[1] 3\n\nnine * 9\n\n[1] 81\n\n\nWe see the results of these operations printed out in the Console.\nWe can also check results of so-called relational operations. There are several relational operators that allow us to compare objects in R. The most useful of these are the following:\n\n\n&gt; greater than, &gt;= greater than or equal to\n\n&lt; less than, &lt;= less than or equal to\n\n== equal to\n\n!= not equal to\n\nWhen we use these to compare two objects in R, we end us with a logical object.\nFor example, let’s check whether 9 is greater than 5, and whether it is lower than 8:\n\n9 &gt; 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n9 &lt; 8\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nR treats our inputs as statements that we are asking it to evaluate, and we get the answers “TRUE” and “FALSE”, respectively, as we would expect. Let’s now check whether our object “nine” is equal to the number 9. We may assume that we can achieve this by typing “nine = 9”, but let’s see what that results in:\n\nnine = 9\n\nDid we get the result we expected? Nothing was printed in the output, so seemingly nothing happened… That’s because the “=” sign is also used as an assignment operator in R, just like “&lt;-”. So we basically assigned the value “9” to the object “nine” again. To use the equal sign as a logical operator we must type it twice (==). Let’s see:\n\nnine == 9\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNow we get the answer “TRUE”, as expected.\nThis distinction between “=” and “==” is important to keep in mind. What would have happened if we had tried to test whether our object “nine” equals value “5” or not, and instead of the logical operator (==) we used the assignment operator (=)? Let’s see:\n\nnine = 5\n\nIn the Console we again see no results printed, but if we check our Environment, we see that the value of the object “nine” was changed to 5. So it can be a dangerous business. We’ll be using the “&lt;-” as assignment operator instead of “=” to avoid any confusion in this respect. The distinction between == and = will also emerge in other contexts later.\nSo, try out the following commands in turn now and check if the results are what you’d expect:\n\nnine == 9\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nnine == 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nfive &lt;- 9\nnine == five\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nfive = nine\nnine == five\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nnine + five &lt;= 10 # lower than or equal to ...\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nThe text following the hashtag (#) in the last line is a comment. If you’d like to comment on any code you write just add a hash (#) or series of hashes in front of it so that R knows it should not evaluate it as a command. This will be useful when writing your commands in an R script that you can save for later, rather than interacting with R live in the Console.",

    "text": "Scripts, markdown documents and projects\nBefore learning to do more with R, let’s learn about some further file types and complete our RStudio setup. Writing brief commands that you want to test out in the Console is okay, but what you really want is to save your commands as part of a workflow in a dedicated file that you can reuse, extend and share with others. In every quantitative analysis, we need to ensure that each step in our analysis is traceable and reproducible. This is increasingly a professional standard expected of all data analysts in the social sciences. This means that we need to have an efficient way in which to share our analysis code, as well as our outputs and interpretations of our findings. RStudio has an efficient way of handling this requirement with the use of R script files and versions of the Markdown markup language that allow the efficient combining of plain text (as in the main body of an article) with analysis code and outputs produced in R. The table below lists the main characteristics of these file types:\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nUse an R script if you want to document a large amount of code used for a particular analysis project. Scripts should contain working R commands and human-readable comments explaining the code. Commands can be run line-by-line, or the whole R script can be run at once. For example, one can write an R script containing a few hundred or thousands of lines of code that gathers and prepares raw, unruly data for analysis; if this script can run without any errors, then it can be saved and sourced from within another script that contains code that undertakes the analysis using the cleansed dataset. Comments can be added by appending them with a hashtag (#).\n\n\nR Markdown\n.Rmd\n\nMarkdown is a simple markup language that allows the formatting of plain text documents. R Markdown is a version of this language written by the R Studio team, which also allows for R code to be included. Plain text documents having the .Rmd extension and containing R Markdown-specific code can be “knitted” (exported) directly into published output document formats such as HTML, PDF or Microsoft Word, which contain both normal text as well as tables and charts produced with the embedded R code. The code itself can also be printed to the output documents.\n\n\nQuarto document\n.qmd\nQuarto is a newer version of R Markdown which allows better compatibility with other programming languages. It is a broader ecosystem design for academic publishing and communication (for example, the course website was built using quarto), but you will be using only Quarto documents in this module. There isn’t much difference between .Rmd and .qmd documents for their uses-cases on this module, so one could easily change and .Rmd extension to .qmd and still produce the same output. .qmd documents are “rendered” instead of “knitted”, but for RStudio users the underlying engine doing the conversion from Quarto/R Markdown to standard Markdown to output file (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) is the same. Read more about Quarto document in the TSD textbook.\n\n\n\nCreating new files can be done easily via the options File &gt; New File &gt;  from the top RStudio menu.\nThe best way to use these files are as part of R project folders, which allow for cross-references to documents and datasets to be made relative to the path of the project folder root. This makes sure that no absolute paths to files (i.e. things like “C:/Documents/Chris/my_article/data_files/my_dataset.rds”) need to be used (instead, you would write something like “~/data_files/my_dataset.rds” if the “my_article” folder was set up as an R Project). This allows for the same code file to be run on another computer too without an error, ensuring a minimal expected level of reproducibility in your workflow.\nSetting up an existing or a new folder as an R Project involves having a file with the extension .RProj saved in it. This can be done easily via the options File &gt; New Project from the top RStudio menu.",

Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   1.20    2.20    5.50    7.04    6.20   20.10 \n\n\nThe seq() function lets us create a sequence from a starting point to an ending point. If you specify the by argument, you can skip values. For instance, if we wanted a vector of every 5th number between 0 and 100, we could write:\n\nnumbers &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)\n\nTo print out the result in the console, we can simply type the name of the object:\n\nnumbers\n\n [1]   0   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90\n[20]  95 100\n\n\nA shorthand version to get a sequence between two numbers counting by 1s is to use the : sign. For example, print out all the numbers between 200 and 250:\n\n200:250\n\n [1] 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218\n[20] 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237\n[39] 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250\n\n\nTo access a single element of a vector by position in the vector, use the square brackets []:\n\nx[2]\n\n[1] 6.2\n\n\nIf you want to access more than one element of a vector, put a vector of the positions you want to access in the brackets:\n\nx[c(2, 5)]\n\n[1]  6.2 20.1\n\n\nIf you try to access an element past the length of the vector, it will return a missing value NA:\n\nx[10]\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nIf you accidentally subset a vector by NA (the missing value), you get the vector back with all its entries replaced by NA:\n\nx[NA]\n\n[1] NA NA NA NA NA\n\n\nLet’s say you want to modify one value in your vector. You can combine the square bracket subset [] with the assignment operator &lt;- to replace a particular value:\n\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2  1.2  5.5 20.1\n\nx[3] &lt;- 50.3\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\n\nYou can replace multiple values at the same time by using a vector for subsetting:\n\nx\n\n[1]  2.2  6.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\nx[1:2] &lt;- c(-1.3, 42)\nx\n\n[1] -1.3 42.0 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\n\nIf the replacement vector (the right-hand side) is shorter than what you are assigning to (the left-hand side), the values will “recycle” or repeat as necessary:\n\nx[1:2] &lt;- 3.2\nx\n\n[1]  3.2  3.2 50.3  5.5 20.1\n\nx[1:4] &lt;- c(1.2, 2.4)\nx\n\n[1]  1.2  2.4  1.2  2.4 20.1\n\n\nYou can also create a vector of characters (words, letters, punctuation, etc):\n\njedi &lt;- c(\"Yoda\", \"Obi-Wan\", \"Luke\", \"Leia\", \"Rey\")\n\nNote for vectors, you cannot mix characters and numbers in the same vector. If you add a single character element, the whole vector gets converted.\n\n### output is numeric\nx\n\n[1]  1.2  2.4  1.2  2.4 20.1\n\n### output is now character\nc(x, \"hey\")\n\n[1] \"1.2\"  \"2.4\"  \"1.2\"  \"2.4\"  \"20.1\" \"hey\" \n\n\nLogical vectors are just vectors that only contain the special R values TRUE or FALSE.\n\nlogical &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\nlogical\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nYou could but never should shorten TRUE to T and FALSE to F. It’s easy for this shortening to go wrong so better just to spell out the full word. Also not that this is case-sensitive, and this will produce an error:\n\ntrue\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'true' not found\n\nTrue\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'True' not found\n\nfalse\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'false' not found",

In a data frame each column is a variable and each row is a case. They look like spreadsheets containing data. There are several toy data frames built into R, and we can have a look at one to see how it looks like. For example, the cars data frame is built into R and so you can access it without loading any files.

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nInstead of programming your own functions in the R language, you can rely on functions written by other people and bundled within a package that performs some set task. There are a large number of reliable, tested and oft-used packages containing functions that are particularly useful for social scientists.\nSome particularly useful packages: - the tidyverse bundle of packages, which includes the dplyr package (for data manipulation) and additional R packages for reading in (readr), transforming (tidyr) and visualizing (ggplot2) datasets. - to import datasets in non-native formats and to manage attached labels (a concept familiar from other statistical packages but foreign to R), load the sjlabelled package (an alternative to haven and labelled, which work in a similar way but provide less functionality) - the sjmisc package contains very useful functions for undertaking data transformations on labelled variables (recoding, grouping, missing values, etc); also has some useful tabulation functions - the sjPlot package contains functions for graphing and tabulating results from regression models\nPackages are often available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or private repositories such as Bioconductor, GitHub etc. Packages made available on CRAN can be installed using the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). Once the package/library is installed (i.e. it is sitting somewhere on your computer), we then need to load it to the current R session using the command library(packagename).\nSo using a package/library is a two-stage process. We:\n\n\nInstall the package/library onto your computer (from the internet)\n\nLoad the package/library into your current session using the library command.\n\nLet’s start by installing the ‘tidyverse’ package, and then load it:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  ## this command installs packages from CRAN; note the quotation marks around the package name\n\nYou can check the suite of packages that are loaded when you load the Tidyverse library using a command from the tidyverse itself:\n\ntidyverse_packages()\n\n\nQuestion\nWhy do you think we got an error message when we tried to run the above command?\n\nBecause tidyverse_packages() is itself a function from the tidyverse, in order to use that function we need not only to install the tidyverse but also to make its functions available. In other words, we did not yet load the tidyverse for use in our R session, we only just installed it on our computers.\nIf we don’t want to load a package that we have downloaded - because maybe we only want to use a single function once and we don’t want to burden our computer’s memory, we can state explicitly which package the function is from in the following way:\n\ntidyverse::tidyverse_packages()  # Here we state the package followed by two colons, then followed by the function we want\n\nBut in many cases we do want to use several functions at various points in an analysis session, so it is usually useful to load the entire package or set of packages:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nNow we can use functions from that package without having to explicitly state the name of the package. We can still state the name explicitly, and that may be useful for readers of our code to understand what package a function come from. Also, it may happen that different packages have similarly named functions, and if all those packages are loaded, then the functions from a package loaded later will override that in the package loaded earlier. R will note in a comment whether any functions from a package are masked by another, so it’s worth paying attention to the comments and warnings printed by R when we load packages.\nThere are also convenience tools - e.g. the pacman package - that make it easier to load several packages at once, while at the same time downloading the package if it has not yet been downloaded on our computer.\nFor example, we can download a number of packages with the command below:\n\n# Install 'pacman' if not yet installed:\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\") \n\n# Then load/install other packages using 'pacman':\n\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse,    # general data management tools ('dplyr', etc.)\n  sjlabelled,   # data import from other software (alternative to 'haven') and labels management\n  sjmisc        # data transformation on variables (recoding,grouping, missing values, etc)\n  )",

    "section": "About the Tidyverse\n",
    "text": "About the Tidyverse\n\nData frames and ‘tibbles’\nThe Tidyverse is built around the basic concept that data in a table should have one observation per row, one variable per column, and only one value per cell. Once data is in this ‘tidy’ format, it can be transformed, visualized and modelled for an analysis.\nWhen using functions in the Tidyverse ecosystem, most data is returned as a tibble object. Tibbles are very similar to the data.frames (which are the basic types of object storing datasets in base R) and it is perfectly fine to use Tidyverse functions on a data.frame object. Just be aware that in most cases, the Tidyverse function will transform your data into a tibble. If you are unobservant, you won’t even notice a difference. However, there are a few differences between the two data types, most of which are just designed to make your life easier. For more info, check R4DS.\nSelected dplyr functions\nThe dplyr package is designed to make it easier to manipulate flat (2-D) data (i.e. the type of datasets we are most likely to use, which are laid out as in a standard spreadsheet, with rows referring to cases (observations; respondents) and columns referring to variables. dplyr provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code. Here are some of the most common functions in dplyr:\n\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\n\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\n\nrename() changes the name of columns.\n\nmutate()/transmute() changes the values of columns and creates new columns (variables)\n\nsummarise() compute statistical summaries (e.g., computing the mean or the sum)\n\ngroup_by() group data into rows with the same values\n\nungroup() remove grouping information from data frame.\n\ndistinct() remove duplicate rows.\n\nAll these functions work similarly as follows:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame/tibble\nThe subsequent arguments are comma separated list of unquoted variable names and the specification of what you want to do\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nFor more info, check R for Social Scientists\nThe forward-pipe (%&gt;%/|&gt;) workflow\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame or tibble as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the forward-pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package. This operator allows us to combine multiple operations into a single sequential chain of actions. As of R 4.1.0 there is also a native pipe operator in R (|&gt;), and in RStudio one can set the shortcut to paste the new pipe operator instead (as we have done at the beginning of the lab). Going forward, we’ll use this version of the pipe operator for simplicity, but it’s likely that you will encounter the older version of the operator too in various scripts.\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a sequence of operations on data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\n\nTake x then\n\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\n\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\n\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\n\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:\nh(g(f(x)))\nThis code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\nx |&gt; \n  f() |&gt; \n  g() |&gt; \n  h()\nYou would read this sequence as:\n\nTake x then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\n\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\n\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. Instead of typing out the three strange characters of the operator, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + M (MacOS) to paste the operator.",

    "text": "Task 4: Data frame operations in a Quarto document\nIn this task, let’s start using the other document we created, the .qmd file. This file format allows you to combine both longer written text (such as detailed descriptions of your data analysis process or the main body of a report or journal article) with code chunks. To get you started using this file format, read Chapter 3.2. in TSD. Below we will focus only on the code chunks.\nCompared to what you have done in the R script, in the main Quarto document a # refers to a heading level rather than a comment. If you want to include a code chunk, you can click on the +C tab in the upper-right corner of the .qmd document’s toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+i. In the code chunk you would write in the same way as you did in the R script (they are basically mini-scripts). Within a code-chunk, therefore, the # still refers to a comment.\nTo execute a command withing a code chunk, you can either run each line/selection separately using Ctrl+Enter as in the R script, or you can run the entire content of the chunk with the green right-pointing triangle-arrow in the upper-right corner of the chunk.\nLet’s continue doing some operations on the mtcars dataset we looked at earlier, this time using some useful tidyverse functions.\nLet’s subset the data frame by selecting certain rows or columns.

For example, to get the 5th through 10th rows:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  slice(5:10)\n\n                   mpg cyl  disp  hp drat   wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.44 17.02  0  0    3    2\nValiant           18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.46 20.22  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360        14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.57 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D         24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.19 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230          22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.15 22.90  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280          19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.44 18.30  1  0    4    4\n\n\nIf we pass a vector of integers to the select function, we will get the variables corresponding to those column positions. So to get the first through third columns:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(1:3) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n                   mpg cyl disp\nMazda RX4         21.0   6  160\nMazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160\nDatsun 710        22.8   4  108\nHornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258\nHornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360\nValiant           18.1   6  225\n\n\nIf you call summary() a data frame, it produces applies the vector version of the summary command to each column:\n\nsummary(mtcars)\n\n      mpg             cyl             disp             hp       \n Min.   :10.40   Min.   :4.000   Min.   : 71.1   Min.   : 52.0  \n 1st Qu.:15.43   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:120.8   1st Qu.: 96.5  \n Median :19.20   Median :6.000   Median :196.3   Median :123.0  \n Mean   :20.09   Mean   :6.188   Mean   :230.7   Mean   :146.7  \n 3rd Qu.:22.80   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:326.0   3rd Qu.:180.0  \n Max.   :33.90   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :472.0   Max.   :335.0  \n      drat             wt             qsec             vs        \n Min.   :2.760   Min.   :1.513   Min.   :14.50   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:3.080   1st Qu.:2.581   1st Qu.:16.89   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :3.695   Median :3.325   Median :17.71   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :3.597   Mean   :3.217   Mean   :17.85   Mean   :0.4375  \n 3rd Qu.:3.920   3rd Qu.:3.610   3rd Qu.:18.90   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :4.930   Max.   :5.424   Max.   :22.90   Max.   :1.0000  \n       am              gear            carb      \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :3.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :0.0000   Median :4.000   Median :2.000  \n Mean   :0.4062   Mean   :3.688   Mean   :2.812  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000",

    "text": "Description\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003, 127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020, 264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020.

The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the module plan page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight lectures (1.5 hours each) and eight IT labs (1.5 hours) . The course stands on three pillars: application, reproducibility and computation.\nApplication: we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.\nReproducibility: developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and collaborative scientific research. We enforce the ideas and procedures of reproducible research both through replicating published research (see above) and in our practice (in the IT labs and the assignment). For an overview of why it’s important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools used in this module, read Chapter 3 of TSD (see Resources&gt;Readings). It’s also worth reading through Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science, although there are now better software options than those discussed there. In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow: the  statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect – the {tidyverse} – via the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n IDE for data analysis, and  for scientific writing and publishing (see Resources&gt;Software).\nComputation: the development of computational methods underpins the application of the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (see Andrew Gelman’s article on these developments here or an online workshop talk here; Richard McElreath’s great talk on Science as Amateur Software Development is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in a textbook such as OpenIntro Statistics (you can download it for free).\nThose who don’t feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and read/practice beyond the compulsory material during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up.\nThose with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.\nNo previous knowledge of  or command-based statistical analysis software is needed. Gaining experience with using statistical software is part of the skills development aims of the module. However, it is not a general data science module, and the IT labs will cover a very limited number of functions (from both base , the tidyverse and other reliable user-written packages) that are most useful for tackling specific analysis tasks. Students are advised to complete some additional self-paced free online training in the use of the software, such as Data Carpentry’s R for Social Scientists, and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund’s R for Data Science) online book.\n\n\n\nThe course and the website were written and are maintained by Chris Moreh."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Description\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube. Others may be better served by this brief TED-Ed animation.",

    "text": "The number of possible outcomes when throwing three six-sided dice, without considering the order of the numbers, is nCr(6+3-1, 3), where nCr represents the number of combinations.\nIn this case, nCr(6+3-1, 3) = nCr(8, 3) = 56. So there are 56 possible outcomes.\nThe formula nCr(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r elements from a set of n elements.\nIn the formula nCr(6+3-1, 3), n is 6+3-1 = 8, which represents the total number of elements in the set when considering all the possible outcomes from rolling three six-sided dice. The -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating dice rolls.\nr is 3, which represents the number of elements we want to choose (in this case, the number of dice rolls we want to consider in a combination).\nSo, nCr(6+3-1, 3) gives us the number of possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from a set of 8 possible outcomes (the 6 possible outcomes from each dice roll plus 2 duplicates). This is also known as the number of ways to choose 3 dice rolls out of 8 possible outcomes.\nThe result nCr(8, 3) = 56 means there are 56 possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from 8 possible outcomes.\n\n\nThe n in nCr(n, r) represents the total number of elements in the set from which we want to choose r elements.\nIn the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes. If we roll three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. However, because we don’t care about the order in which the dice land, we need to remove the duplicate combinations that would result from simply rearranging the order of the same three outcomes.\nTo account for duplicates, we consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n elements, where n is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from rolling three dice.\nTo calculate n, we can use the formula n = n + r - 1, where n is the total number of outcomes from rolling the dice (in this case, 6), and r is the number of dice we’re rolling (in this case, 3).\nSo in this case, n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8. This means that we have 8 unique combinations of dice rolls, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. And the number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\n\n\nThe formula n = n + r - 1 is used to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, when the elements can be repeated.\nThe reasoning behind this formula is as follows:\nImagine you have n distinct elements, and you want to form combinations of r elements. In this case, the number of unique combinations is simply nCr(n, r).\nHowever, when elements can be repeated, the number of unique combinations is not simply nCr(n, r), because the same combination of elements can be formed by rearranging the same r elements in different orders. To account for this, we need to consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n + r - 1 elements, where n + r - 1 is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from the n elements.\nThe -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating elements, so we need to remove one duplicate combination that would result from simply rearranging the same r elements.\nSo in the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes, giving us n = 6 unique elements. If we roll three dice, we have r = 3 elements. And to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, where elements can be repeated, we use the formula n = n + r - 1, giving us n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.\nThis means that there are 8 unique combinations of dice rolls that can be formed from rolling three six-sided dice, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. The number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\n\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations using the combination formula nCr(m, r)\ncombinations &lt;- choose(m, r)\ncombinations\n\n[1] 56\n\n\nThis code returns the value 56, which is the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of m elements, where m = n + r - 1 and n is the number of unique elements and r is the number of elements to choose. This is the same result as we found earlier using nCr(8, 3).\n\n\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to m\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:m, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to n\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:n, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3"
