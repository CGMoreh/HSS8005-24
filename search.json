    "text": "ReadingsSoftwareTrainingHelp\n\n\n\nTextbooks\nThe course does not strictly follow the content of a textbook, but the expectation is that students will read as much as possible of the assigned chapters from the following books:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020. Regression and other stories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ROS\n\n\nFree to download PDF version from the book’s website: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman and Hall/CRC  TSD\n\n\nFree online book: https://tellingstorieswithdata.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., and Hill, J. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ARM\n\n\nNote: ROS is the expanded and updated version of Part 1 (and some of Part 3) of this book. While everyone in the free world eagerly awaits the publication of ROS’s multilevel counterpart, we’ll use ARM as a reference work for the theory underpinning multilevel modelling.  Not freely available. Access it in print or online via the NU library\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week from these books, referring to them by their acronyms. Don’t worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week! Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.\n\n\nApplication\nIn the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week’s outline (still work in progress!).\nThe articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.\nWhen selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don’t take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!\n\n\nTechnique\nThere will also be various readings relating more closely to the technicalities of coding in R and scientific writing, collaboration and communication in general. These readings will also be listed under each week’s outline as the semester progresses. The generic reading that students are advised to go through on their own is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science (2nd ed.)  R4DS\n\n\nFree online book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition\nFinally, there will also be recommended readings listed under certain weeks that help place methods, statistics and probability theory in a broader frame. These are useful readings for everyone, regardless of whether you will be applying quantitative analysis in your research or future work.\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\nWe will use a number of open-source software for data analysis and scientific writing. You need to install these on your personal computers to be able to work away from campus:\n\n\n\n\nR\n(programming language)\nEssential\nR needs to be installed even if we will only use it via the RStudio interface.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nRStudio\n(integrated development environment)\nEssential\nYou will need the free desktop version appropriate for your operating system. RStudio combines the R Console - the direct interface to R - with a number of other panels.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nTidyverse\n(collection of R packages)\nEssential\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages that make the R language easier to use by introducing a more consistent grammar. It provides functions that are particularly useful for data manipulation and visualisation. It is the most common ‘dialect’ used among social scientists.\nInstall from within RStudio by executing in the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nQuarto\n(scientific publishing system)\nEssential\nWe will be using Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) throughout the course to document our data analysis. .qmd files extend the plain-text Markdown mark-up language (.md) to allow for data analysis code to be executed and results presented alongside the main text. This is an essential requirement for analytical transparency, reliability and reproducibility.The assignment will also be completed in .qmd.\nIncluded by default in the latest RStudio release; no need to install separately.\nYou can check your installation by executing in the RStudio Terminal :\nquarto check\n\n\n\nZotero\n(reference manager)\nRecommended\nIf you are not yet using a reference manager, I recommend giving Zotero a try. It will make your work much more efficient and it integrates (relatively well) with RMarkdown and Quarto using the the Better BibTeX add-on.\nInstall the latest version and add-ons from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with no previous experience using R and/or RStudio are advised to complete the self-paced free online training course R for Social Scientists provided by Data Carpentry at https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to get help with  outside class. If you encounter an error message or are looking for a function to perform a specific task that we have not covered in class, you can do a Google search; for best results, use the https://rseek.org/ search engine, which limits the results to those relating to the  language.\nYou can also search for answers on Stack Overflow, which is a popular help and discussion website for programmers. You can also post a question there, but make sure to follow community standards and advice on how to ask a good question and how to provide a minimal reproducible example. You will need some experience using the site before being able to ask a good question, but it’s more than certain that any question you have at this stage has already been asked and answered somewhere. Make sure you do a comprehensive search with various prompts before thinking about asking your question.\nIncreasingly, large language model-based chatbots such as the (in)famous ChatGPT can also provide good answers. You can use them efficiently, but make sure to always test out the responses, in the overwhelming majority of the cases the advice they give is unreliable, at least at first try."

    "section": "Exercise 2: Use R as a simple calculator",
    "text": "Exercise 2: Use R as a simple calculator\nThe most elementary yet still handy task you can use R for is to perform basic arithmetic operations. This is useful for getting a first experience doing things in the R language.\nLet’s have a look at a few operations using the Console directly. Let’s say we want to know the result of adding up three numbers: 1, 3 and 5. In the Console pane, type the command below and then click Enter:\n\n1 + 3 + 5\n\nThis will print out the result (9) in the Console:\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nThe [1] in the result is just the line number; in this case, our result only consists of a single line.\nWe can also save the result of this operation as an object, so we can use it for further operations. We create objects by using the so-called assignment operator consisting of the characters &lt;-.\nA command involving &lt;- can be read as “assign the value of the result from the operation on the right hand side (some expression) to the object on the left hand side (short name of object, single word, with no spaces)”.\nFor example, let’s save our result in an object called “nine”:\n\nnine &lt;- 1 + 3 + 5\n\nNotice that there is no output printed in the Console this time. But there are also no error messages, so the operation must have run without problems. Instead, if we look at the Environment pane, we notice that it is no longer empty, but contains an object called “nine” that stores the value “9” in it. We can now use this object for other operations, such as:\n\nnine - 3\nnine + 15\nnine / 3\nnine * 9\n\nWe see the results of these operations printed out in the Console.\nWe can also check results of so-called relational operations. There are several relational operators that allow us to compare objects in R. The most useful of these are the following:\n\n\n&gt; greater than, &gt;= greater than or equal to\n\n&lt; less than, &lt;= less than or equal to\n\n== equal to\n\n!= not equal to\n\nWhen we use these to compare two objects in R, we end up with a logical object.\nFor example, let’s check whether 9 is greater than 5, and whether it is lower than 8:\n\n9 &gt; 5\n9 &lt; 8\n\nR treats our inputs as statements that we are asking it to evaluate, and we get the answers “TRUE” and “FALSE”, respectively, as we would expect. Let’s now check whether our object “nine” is equal to the number 9. We may assume that we can achieve this by typing “nine = 9”, but let’s see what that results in:\n\nnine = 9\n\nDid we get the result we expected? Nothing was printed in the output, so seemingly nothing happened… That’s because the “=” sign is also used as an assignment operator in R, just like “&lt;-”. So we basically assigned the value “9” to the object “nine” again. To use the equal sign as a logical operator we must type it twice (==). Let’s see:\n\nnine == 9\n\nNow we get the answer “TRUE”, as expected.\nThis distinction between “=” and “==” is important to keep in mind. What would have happened if we had tried to test whether our object “nine” equals value “5” or not, and instead of the logical operator (==) we used the assignment operator (=)? Let’s see:\n\nnine = 5\n\nIn the Console we again see no results printed, but if we check our Environment, we see that the value of the object “nine” was changed to 5. So it can be a dangerous business. We’ll be using the “&lt;-” as assignment operator instead of “=” to avoid any confusion in this respect. The distinction between == and = will also emerge in other contexts later.\nSo, try out the following commands in turn now and check if the results are what you’d expect:\n\nnine == 9\nnine == 5\nfive &lt;- 9\nnine == five\nfive = nine\nnine == five\nnine + five &lt;= 10 # lower than or equal to ...\n\nThe text following the hashtag (#) in the last line is a comment. If you’d like to comment on any code you write just add a hash (#) or series of hashes in front of it so that R knows it should not evaluate it as a command. This will be useful when writing your commands in an R script that you can save for later, rather than interacting with R live in the Console.",

    "section": "Exercise 4: Vector operations",
    "text": "Exercise 4: Vector operations\nLet’s learn a few vector operations. Type/copy the code below to the R script file your created earlier (“Lab_1.R”), and save it at the end for your records.\nFirst, let’s use the c() function to concatenate vector elements:\n\nx &lt;- c(2.2, 6.2, 1.2, 5.5, 20.1)\n\nTo run this line of code in an R script, place the cursor on the line you want to execute and either click on the small “Run” tab in the upper-right corner of the script’s task bar, or click Ctrl+Enter (on Windows PCs).\nThe vector called x that we just created appears in the Environment. We can examine some of its features:\n\nclass(x)\ntypeof(x)\nlength(x)\nattributes(x)\n\nThese tell us something about the characteristics of the object, but not much about its content (apart from the fact that it has a length of 5). Functions such as min, max, range, mean, median, sum or summary give us some summary statistics about the object:\n\nmin(x)\nmax(x)\nrange(x)\nmean(x)\nmedian(x)\nsum(x)\nsummary(x)\n\nThe seq() function lets us create a sequence from a starting point to an ending point. If you specify the by argument, you can skip values. For instance, if we wanted a vector of every 5th number between 0 and 100, we could write:\n\nnumbers &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 5)\n\nTo print out the result in the console, we can simply type the name of the object:\n\nnumbers\n\nA shorthand version to get a sequence between two numbers counting by 1s is to use the : sign. For example, print out all the numbers between 200 and 250:\n\n200:250\n\nTo access a single element of a vector by position in the vector, use the square brackets []:\n\nx[2]\n\nIf you want to access more than one element of a vector, put a vector of the positions you want to access in the brackets:\n\nx[c(2, 5)]\n\nIf you try to access an element past the length of the vector, it will return a missing value NA:\n\nx[10]\n\nIf you accidentally subset a vector by NA (the missing value), you get the vector back with all its entries replaced by NA:\n\nx[NA]\n\nLet’s say you want to modify one value in your vector. You can combine the square bracket subset [] with the assignment operator &lt;- to replace a particular value:\n\nx\nx[3] &lt;- 50.3\nx\n\nYou can replace multiple values at the same time by using a vector for subsetting:\n\nx\nx[1:2] &lt;- c(-1.3, 42)\nx\n\nIf the replacement vector (the right-hand side) is shorter than what you are assigning to (the left-hand side), the values will “recycle” or repeat as necessary:\n\nx[1:2] &lt;- 3.2\nx\n\nx[1:4] &lt;- c(1.2, 2.4)\nx\n\nYou can also create a vector of characters (words, letters, punctuation, etc):\n\njedi &lt;- c(\"Yoda\", \"Obi-Wan\", \"Luke\", \"Leia\", \"Rey\")\n\nNote for vectors, you cannot mix characters and numbers in the same vector. If you add a single character element, the whole vector gets converted.\n\n### output is numeric\nx\n\n### output is now character\nc(x, \"hey\")\n\nLogical vectors are just vectors that only contain the special R values TRUE or FALSE.\n\nlogical &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)\nlogical\n\nYou could but never should shorten TRUE to T and FALSE to F. It’s easy for this shortening to go wrong so better just to spell out the full word. Also not that this is case-sensitive, and this will produce an error:\n\ntrue\nTrue\nfalse",

    "text": "Exercise 6: Data frame operations in a Quarto document\nIn this task, let’s start using the other document we created, the .qmd file. This file format allows you to combine both longer written text (such as detailed descriptions of your data analysis process or the main body of a report or journal article) with code chunks. To get you started using this file format, read Chapter 3.2. in TSD. Below we will focus only on the code chunks.\nCompared to what you have done in the R script, in the main Quarto document a # refers to a heading level rather than a comment. If you want to include a code chunk, you can click on the +C tab in the upper-right corner of the .qmd document’s toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+i. In the code chunk you would write in the same way as you did in the R script (they are basically mini-scripts). Within a code-chunk, therefore, the # still refers to a comment.\nTo execute a command withing a code chunk, you can either run each line/selection separately using Ctrl+Enter as in the R script, or you can run the entire content of the chunk with the green right-pointing triangle-arrow in the upper-right corner of the chunk.\nLet’s continue doing some operations on the mtcars dataset we looked at earlier, this time using some useful tidyverse functions.\nLet’s subset the data frame by selecting certain rows or columns. In tidyverse, you can do this with the filter() function for selecting rows and the select() function for selecting columns. Here we pipe the selections into head() to show the first few rows. You could also use the dplyr::slice_head function\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(mpg, wt) |&gt;\n  head()\n\nTo select the cars with eight cylinders:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  filter(cyl == 8)\n\nWe can use the slice() function. For example, to get the 5th through 10th rows:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  slice(5:10)\n\nIf we pass a vector of integers to the select function, we will get the variables corresponding to those column positions. So to get the first through third columns:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(1:3) |&gt;\n  head()\n\nIf you call summary() a data frame, it produces applies the vector version of the summary command to each column:\n\nsummary(mtcars)\n\nThese few tasks should be enough to get you started with R and RStudio.\nIf this was your first encounter with R, you can complete the R for Social Scientists online training too sometime during the week.\nFrom next week we will begin working actively with real data and address specific data management challenges that arise from there.\nThose of you who have worked on the advanced user exercise can check some optional solutions below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to the advanced exercise: leap year functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleap_year_v1 &lt;- function(year1,year2) {\n    year &lt;- year1:year2\n    year[(year%%4==0 & year%%100!=0) | year%%400==0]\n}\n\n\nleap_year_v2 &lt;- function(year1,year2){\n    vector&lt;-c()\n    for(year in year1:year2){\n        if((year %% 4 == 0) & (year %% 100 != 0) | (year  %% 400 == 0)){\n            vector&lt;-c(vector,year)\n        }}\n    return(vector)}\n\n\nleap_year_v3 &lt;- function(year1,year2){\n    #make a vector of all years\n    year&lt;-year1:year2\n    #find the leap years (TRUE/FALSE)\n    leaps&lt;-ifelse((year %% 4 == 0) & (year %% 100 != 0) | (year  %% 400 == 0), TRUE, FALSE)\n    year[leaps] #return the leap years\n}",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nTo introduce logistic regression, we replicate part of the results presented in Wu (2021), specifically a simpler version of their Model 1 in Appendix A. Table 2, with only individual-level variables and pooled data that disregards the hierarchical nature of the dataset. The main problem addressed by Wu (2021) is the relationship between education and social trust at a global level, and for this they partially use data from Waves 5 and 6 of the World Values Survey.\nThe WVS measures social trust with a binary question:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?:\n1 = Most people can be trusted\n2 = Need to be very careful\n\n\n\nThis variable will serve as the outcome variable.\nPrevious research had generally concluded that “there is a strong and positive relation between education level and trust” (Wu 2021:1167). However,\n\n“several studies have shown that education might yield differential impacts on trust in different societies. In Sweden, Sven Oskarsson et al. (2017) show that education has little impact on trust. In China, Cary Wu and Zhilei Shi (2020) suggest that education has a negative impact on people’s trust. Several cross-national studies have also shown that the education and trust association can vary from positive to negative depending on the specific institutional contexts … For example, the effect of education is found to be negative in highly corrupt countries such as Serbia, Turkey, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, and Ukraine” (p. 1167).\n\nWu (2021) investigates how individual-level (micro) factors (such as education level and risk-taking propensity) may have different effects on trust depending on country-level (macro) factors (such as sociopolitical risk). We will focus on the individual (micro) level in this exercise, using measurements of education level and risk-taking propensity as our main explanatory variables. Following Wu (2021:1172), we will also control for a number of demographic variables at the individual level (“gender, age, income, marital status, and occupational status”).",

    "text": "Data\nThe data required for this analysis can be downloaded freely from the World Values Survey website. We download Wave 5 (2005-2009) and Wave 6 (2010-2014) data. These are the only waves that measured risk-taking propensity using Schwartz’s value item,\n\n“where respondents were asked to report their similarity to a hypothetical individual: “Adventure and taking risks are important to this person; to have an exciting life.” Respondents rated the statement using a 6-point scale (1 = very much like me, 6 = not at all like me)” (Wu 2021:1172).\n\nThe latest wave of the WVS does not include this variable. Wu (2021) describe the other variables they use\n\nFor the WVS, I measure educational attainment using respondents’ highest education level attained with eight categories, namely, 1 = no formal education or inadequately completed elementary education, 2 = completed (compulsory) elementary education, 3 = incomplete secondary school: technical/vocational, 4 = complete secondary school: technical/vocational, 5 = incomplete secondary: university, 6 = complete secondary: university, 7 = some university without degree, and 8 = university with degree/higher education.\n\n\nIn some analyses, I treat education as a categorical variable. To reduce the number of categories, I recode respondents’ education into Primary, Secondary, Post-secondary, and Tertiary. This is also consistent with the most recent wave of the WVS coding (p. 1171)\n\n\nI also control for relevant demographic covariates such as gender, age, income, marital status, and occupational status at the individual level (p. 1172)\n\nWe can also find the questionnaires and the codebooks on the survey website, which will help identify the relevant variables.\nThe code below imports and selects the data from the original WVS dataset and creates a data-frame called wvs56 that contains all the variables needed:\n\n\nRaw data import and management\n## Paths to files --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Data was downloaded in SPSS (.sav) format from the WVS website (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp)\n### Downloaded data files were extracted and saved in the folder \"raw\" within the folder \"data\"\n### Create paths to the data files are created from the RProject root folder; cross-check the created path string variable:\n\nwvs5_path &lt;- here::here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"WV5_Data_Spss_v20180912.sav\")\nwvs6_path &lt;- here::here(\"data\", \"raw\", \"WV6_Data_sav_v20201117.sav\")\n\n\n## Select variables ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Create a vector storing names for the variables that will be used, based on Wu (2021: 1170-1172):\n\nwu_vars &lt;- c(\"country\", \"year\", \"trust\", \"risktaker\", \"education\", \"sex\", \"age\", \"income\", \"marstat\", \"employment\")\n\n### Create vectors storing the original names of the relevant variables in the WVS5 and WVS6 datasets:\n\nwvs5_vars &lt;- c(\"V2\", \"V260\", \"V23\", \"V86\", \"V238\", \"V235\", \"V237\", \"V253\", \"V55\", \"V241\")\nwvs6_vars &lt;- c(\"V2\", \"V262\", \"V24\", \"V76\", \"V248\", \"V240\", \"V242\", \"V239\", \"V57\", \"V229\")\n\n\n## Read in the data files -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwvs5 &lt;- read_spss(wvs5_path) |&gt; \n  data_select(select = c(wvs5_vars)) \n\nwvs6 &lt;- read_spss(wvs6_path) |&gt; \n  data_select(select = c(wvs6_vars))\n\n\n## Read in the data files -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Create codebooks to check variables\n### Comparing the codebooks we see that the coding of all the variables is similar\n### WVS6 has shorter value labels on some variables\n\nwvs5_codebook &lt;- wvs5 |&gt; \n  data_codebook()\n\nwvs6_codebook &lt;- wvs6 |&gt; \n  data_codebook() \n\n \n## Rename variables -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### It's safe to replace the original var names with more human-readable names; we use `datawizard::data_rename()`\n### Replace the value codes of `country` and `year` with the labels; will make merging datasets less error-prone\n\nwvs5 &lt;- wvs5 |&gt; \n  data_rename(c(wvs5_vars), c(wu_vars)) |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\nwvs6 &lt;- wvs6 |&gt; \n  data_rename(c(wvs6_vars), c(wu_vars)) |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(c(\"country\", \"year\"))\n\n## Merge data files -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Now variable names are the same in both datasets, the two can be joined\n### `datawizard::data_merge(..., join = \"bind\")` is similar to `dplyr::bind_rows()` but also copies value labels from the first-mentioned dataset\n### We mention the `wvs6` dataset first to keep its (shorter) version of value labels\n\nwvs56 &lt;- data_merge(wvs6, wvs5, join = \"bind\")\n\n## Create new `country_year` variable -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwvs56 &lt;- data_unite(wvs56, new_column = \"country_year\", c(\"country\", \"year\"), append = TRUE)",

    "section": "Recoding variables",
    "text": "Recoding variables\nThere are a few final alterations that need to be made to the variables:\n\ntrust will serve as our response (dependent) variable - the one we want to explain/model. We can see from the codebook that it has two valid categories (“1” and “2”), referring to “Most people can be trusted” and “Need to be very careful”, respectively. Given that it is a binary (dichotomous) variable, we will use binary logistic regression to model it. When we enter a variable into a logistic regression model as dependent variable in R, the first category/level will be automatically recoded internally to the value “0” and be used as the reference category; the latter category/level will be recoded to “1”, and it will be the indicator category that the model predicts in contrast to the reference category. In our case, that will mean that the category referring to “Need to be very careful” will be treated as the indicator variable by default, so effectively the coefficients of the explanatory (predictor, independent) variables will be estimating the propensity towards “distrust”. If we first reversed the order of the categories in the dependent variable, the output would be estimating “trust”, which is conceptually cleaner and more straightforward to interpret;\nFollowing Wu (2021), we can treat our main explanatory variable - education (Highest educational level attained) - as numeric. But in the dataset it is coded as factor, so we will have to either change it to numeric in the dataset, or force it to be treated as numeric by R when fitting the model. Technically, education is categorical in nature, but given that the categories are ordinal in their substantive meaning (increasing from no/less education to more) and there are more than just a handful of levels/categories (there are 9), we can technically treat it as a short numeric scale, while keeping in mind that descriptive statistics such as the mean do not make much sense in this case;\nWu (2021) also noted that in some models (including in Model 1, Appendix A. Table 2) they use a recoded categorical version of the education, collapsed over 4 categories: “Primary”, “Secondary”, “Post-secondary”, and “Tertiary” education. We can also create this variable to potentially include it in our models.\n\nWe can make the required transformations in a single call to the {datawizard} function data_modify() like so:\n\nwvs56 &lt;- wvs56 |&gt;                                                                         # (1)\n  data_modify(trusting = recode_values(trust,\n                                       recode = list(\"0\" = 2)),                           # (2)\n              educ_num = as_numeric(education),                                           # (3)\n              educ_cat_1 = recode_values(education,                                       # (4)\n                                         recode = list(\"1\" = (\"1, 2, 3\"), \n                                                       \"2\" = (\"4, 5, 6, 7\"), \n                                                       \"3\" = (\"8\"),\n                                                       \"4\" = (\"9\"))),                     # (4.1)\n              educ_cat_2 = recode_values(education,                                       # (5)\n                                         recode = list(\"1\" = (\"1, 2\"),\n                                                       \"2\" = (\"3\"), \n                                                       \"3\" = (\"4, 5\"), \n                                                       \"4\" = (\"6, 7\"),\n                                                       \"5\" = (\"8\"),\n                                                       \"6\" = (\"9\")))\n              ) |&gt;                                                                        # (6)\n  set_labels(trusting, labels = c(\"Not trusting\", \"Trusting\")) |&gt;                         # (7)\n  set_labels(educ_cat_1, labels = c(\"Primary\", \n                                    \"Secondary\", \n                                    \"Post-secondary\", \n                                    \"Tertiary\")) |&gt; \n  set_labels(educ_cat_2, labels = c(\"Less than primary\", \n                                    \"Primary\", \n                                    \"Secondary-vocational\", \n                                    \"Secondary-preparatory\", \n                                    \"Post-secondary\", \n                                    \"Tertiary\"))\n  \n# Code explanation:\n# (1) overwrite the data object with the changes\n# (2) reverse the category order of \"trust\" and save it as a new variable called \"trusting\" to make the indicator meaning clearer\n# (3) change the type of variable \"education\" to numeric and save it as the new variable \"educ_num\"\n# (4) recode the \"education\" variable into 4 larger categories and save the new variable as \"educ_cat_1\"\n# (4.1) make sure to close all the brackets under `recode_values()`\n# (5) alternative recode of \"education\" into 6 categories as \"educ_cat_2\"\n# (6) remember to close the brackets under `data_modify()`\n# (7) add value labels\n\nOf course, we could do all the changes one-by-one, but because we can achieve everything we wanted using the data_modify() option, it’s easier to do it all at once. When you are experimenting with recoding, it is probably a good idea to do it one-by-one and check the results at each step to catch out any errors more easily.\nLet’s have a look at the recoded dataset;

    "text": "Describing the relationship between the main variables of interest\nNow that the data has been recoded, we can have a closer look at the relationship between our two main variables: trusting and educ_num. Since the education variable is now recorded as numeric, we can make use of a boxplot for visualisation. In Week 2 we practiced building {ggplot2} plots incrementally, and the boxplot could be coded like this:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(wvs56) +\n  aes(trusting, educ_num) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1358 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also set the value labels as the values to plot, and we could remove the missing values:\n\n\nCode\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n    aes(trusting, educ_num) +\n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\nWarning: Removed 35274 rows containing missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile ggplot2::ggplot() is flexible and useful for expanding the plots and adding various embellishments, the {ggformula} package simplifies its syntax by making it similar to the formula syntax used in common modelling functions (such as lm()). All the {ggformula} commands begin with gf_ followed by the type of the plot. The command for a boxplot would be as simple as:\n\n\nCode\ngf_boxplot(educ_num ~ trusting, data = wvs56)\n\n\nWarning: Removed 1358 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also complies with pipe workflows, like for example:\n\n\nCode\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  gf_boxplot(educ_num ~ trusting)\n\n\nWarning: Removed 35274 rows containing missing values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the boxplots, we can see a slightly higher median education level among those in the “Trusting” category (those who responded that “Most people can be trusted” in the survey). For a more detailed numerical summary of this association, we can use another function from the {datawizard} package, means_by_group():\n\n\nCode\nwvs56 |&gt; means_by_group(\"educ_num\", \"trusting\")\n\n\n# Mean of Highest educational level attained by Most people can be trusted\n\nCategory     | Mean |     N |   SD |       95% CI |      p\n----------------------------------------------------------\nNot trusting | 5.32 | 1e+05 | 2.44 | [5.30, 5.33] | &lt; .001\nTrusting     | 5.88 | 41646 | 2.49 | [5.86, 5.90] | &lt; .001\nTotal        | 5.46 | 2e+05 | 2.46 |              |       \n\nAnova: R2=0.010; adj.R2=0.010; F=1641.932; p&lt;.001\n\n\nHere we can see more clearly the difference in average education levels between those with high trust levels and those with low trust levels. This table is equivalent to the results from a linear regression model in which the numeric variable educ_num is the dependent variable and trusting is the explanatory (independent) variable. We should keep in mind, however, that while our educ_num variable is treated as numeric, it is in fact an ordinal categorical variable, and a mean value of 5.88 over trusting cannot be interpreted meaningfully. If we are interested in only in differences, we can calculate the median educ_num - and any other statistics - over trusting manually:\n\n\nCode\nwvs56 |&gt; \n  labels_to_levels(trusting) |&gt; \n  remove_missing() |&gt; \n  data_group(trusting) |&gt; \n  summarize(mean_educ = mean(educ_num),\n            median_educ = median(educ_num))\n\n\nWarning: Removed 35274 rows containing missing values.\n\n\n      trusting mean_educ median_educ\n1 Not trusting  5.379452           5\n2     Trusting  5.977591           6\n\n\nOut interest, however, is in modelling the trusting variable as a function of education, while also accounting for the other demographic covariates. For this, we turn to a logistic regression model.",

    "text": "Simple bivariate logistic regression model\nFitting a logistic regression model in R is fairly straightforward. We can use the base R glm() function and would write the following code:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_1 &lt;- glm(trusting ~ educ_num, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), data = wvs56)\n\n\nIn the code above, instead of the linear model function (lm()) we used the generalised linear model function (glm()), and because glm() is a larger family of models, we need to also specify which “family” we are fitting; since our dependent variable is binary variable, we are calling the “binomial” family. We also need to specify a “link function” to be used, but the “logit” is the default link for the binomial distribution family, so we could have ommitted it and simply written glm(..., family = binomial).\nIn all other aspects the formula is the same as the one we already know from linear regression.\nLet’s look at the model parameters:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_parameters(model_1)\n\n\nProfiled confidence intervals may take longer time to compute.\n  Use `ci_method=\"wald\"` for faster computation of CIs.\n\n\nParameter   | Log-Odds |       SE |         95% CI |       z |      p\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |    -1.60 |     0.01 | [-1.63, -1.58] | -109.36 | &lt; .001\neduc num    |     0.09 | 2.35e-03 | [ 0.09,  0.10] |   40.14 | &lt; .001\n\n\n\nUncertainty intervals (profile-likelihood) and p-values (two-tailed)\n  computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.\n\n\n\nThe model has a log- or logit-link. Consider using `exponentiate =\n  TRUE` to interpret coefficients as ratios.\n\n\nIt is at the stage of interpretation that logistic regression models become difficult. The coefficients that we obtain in the standard output are similar to those from a linear regression in that they summarise a linear and additive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The difference is that the dependent variable has been transformed to a logit or logged odds scale. We could say - following the logic of linear regression - that each unit difference in one’s education level is associated with a 0.18-point positive difference in the logged odds/logit value of trusting. But this doesn’t make much sense, because the logit scale is difficult to comprehend.\nIt would be more intuitive to see the results on a different scale. A simple and commonly used transformation is from log-odds to odds ratios. If we exponentiate the logistic regression log-odds coefficients, we could say that the independent variables relate to the odds of the dependent variable, rather than the logged odds, which is somewhat easier to relate to. The model_parameters() function can do that for us in exchange of some additional specification:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_parameters(model_1, exponentiate = TRUE)\n\n\nProfiled confidence intervals may take longer time to compute.\n  Use `ci_method=\"wald\"` for faster computation of CIs.\n\n\nParameter   | Odds Ratio |       SE |       95% CI |       z |      p\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |       0.20 | 2.95e-03 | [0.20, 0.21] | -109.36 | &lt; .001\neduc num    |       1.10 | 2.59e-03 | [1.09, 1.10] |   40.14 | &lt; .001\n\n\n\nUncertainty intervals (profile-likelihood) and p-values (two-tailed)\n  computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.\n\n\nThe odds ratios that we find in this table are somewhat easier to interpret, but we need to understand how odds work. By having exponentiated the coefficients, we have moved from an additive scale to a multiplicative scale. Basically, what this means is that while on an additive scale the value “0” means no change (because by adding 0 to a number we do not alter that number), on a multiplicative scale that role is taken over by “1” (when we multiply a number by “1”, we keep it as it is). Consequently, a coefficient of “1” on the exponentiated scale means no difference, while values between 0 and 1 represent a negative difference and values greater than 1 a positive difference.\nI our case, the OR of 1.10 means that a difference of one degree in education level is associated with a positive difference of 1.10 in the odds of being a trusting person. We could further translate this into a percentage: if we subtract 1 from the exponentiated coefficient and multiply it by 100, we get the percentage difference due to a unit change in the independent variable.\n\\[\n\\% \\Delta _{odds} = 100\\times(OR-1)\n\\]\nFor values grater than 1 this calculation is straightforward. In our case, this translates to a 10% increase in the odds of being a trusting person.\nIt doesn’t add much to our understanding to plot the regression results from a model with a single predictor, but knowing how to plot results will be particularly useful once we expand the model with further explanatory variables. To create a plot of the results, we can simply take the output from the model_parameters() function and pass it on to the plot() function included in {easystats}:\n\n\nCode\nparameters(model_1, exponentiate = TRUE) |&gt; plot()\n\n\nProfiled confidence intervals may take longer time to compute.\n  Use `ci_method=\"wald\"` for faster computation of CIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the fact that the exponentiated coefficients are measured on a multiplicative scale poses some difficulties and it makes it easy to fall into the trap of interpreting these odds as probabilities.\nThe issue is that odds can range from 0 to infinity, so the scale is far from standard. Probabilities, on the other hand, have the nice feature of being constrained between 0 and 1, so a percentage change has much more meaning.\nThere are several packages that help us compute various comparative statistics on the probability scale from logistic models.\nBelow, we will use the avg_slopes() function from the {marginaleffects} package to compute the average difference in the probability of being trusting based on a one-unit difference in education level:\n\n\nCode\navg_slopes(model_1)\n\n\n\n     Term Estimate Std. Error    z Pr(&gt;|z|)   S  2.5 % 97.5 %\n educ_num   0.0178   0.000436 40.7   &lt;0.001 Inf 0.0169 0.0186\n\nColumns: term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, s.value, conf.low, conf.high \nType:  response \n\n\nThe result indicates the change in the predicted probability that the outcome (trusting) equals 1. On average, a unit-change in educ_num changes the predicted probability that the outcome equals 1 by 1.8%.\nThis “average marginal” effect represents the average slope of the predictor, and as such it can be considered as an “adjusted regression coefficient”. However, because the effect is no longer fixed across the values of the predictor variable, it is still less intuitive to talk about an “average” effect in the case of logistic regression.\nTo make these numerical results easier to visualise, we can plot the result.There are several options, but probably the most straightforward approach is to estimate the probabilities of being trusting at each level of the predictor variable (educ_num), then plot the results. The plot_predictions() function from the {marginaleffects} package or the plot() function of {ggeffects} can be used here. Below, we’ll use the latter:\n\n\nCode\nggpredict(model_1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code first calculates predictions of the outcome probability for each level of the explanatory variable using the ggpredict() function (we could save these results as a data-frame), then passes those results on to the plot() function. To remove the overlapping value labels on the horizontal axis, we could add something like the following to the command:\n\n\nCode\nggpredict(model_1, \"educ_num\") |&gt; \n  plot() +\n    scale_x_continuous()\n\n\nScale for x is already present.\nAdding another scale for x, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph makes it a lot clearer how education is associated with trust in our model, and if education is our main variable of interest, we can plot its effect even from a larger model that contains other covariates.",

    "text": "So far we have looked at toy datasets included with R itself. In your own research - and in later weeks in this module - you will be using real data. But how do we get these data into RStudio? It depends, of course, on the format of the data you need to import.\nR’s native data format carries the extension .rds. The base-R function to load .rds datasets into R is readRDS().\nBut we can import data stored in other formats too, such as the generic comma separated values (.csv) format or the various formats used by other proprietary statistical analysis packages (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS).\nMany social science surveys are distributed in one of the proprietary formats mentioned, because those have been designed specifically to manage “labelled” data (i.e. variables that need to have longer descriptive labels and consist of many categorical variables whose categories/levels only make sense if they are themselves meaningfully “labelled”).\nFor example, the The World Values Survey (WVS) provides the greatest number of options for data download formats, including .rds and even .RData. However, most other large-scale cross-national surveys provide their data either in .csv, .sav (SPSS) or .dta (Stata).\nWhen you have the option, my advice is to download the .sav (SPSS) version of the data whenever possible, just because SPSS allows the longest variable and value labels and therefore that data labelling may be the most complete. It’s then easier to transport that to R than having to type everything in from a survey questionnaire when that information is needed.\nTraditionally, one of the most severe shortcomings of R compared to other proprietary statistical analysis packages has been it’s very limited and cumbersome support of labelling. This has changed significantly over the past few years. The suite of packages developed or contributed to by sociologist Daniel Lüdecke of the University of Hamburg are among the best available tools for this purpose - including the packages making up the {easystats} ecosystem.\nAs an example, let’s import a dataset from the latest wave of the World Values Survey (Wave 7). Two versions of the dataset are available via the module website (.rds and .sav), but you can download the data in other formats directly from the survey website: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV7.jsp.\nDownload the .rds version of the data file form here: https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-24/data/wvs7.rds\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure to download the file in the same folder where your R script/Quarto file is located, so you can import it easily, without complications cause by directory paths (see below)\n\n\nOnce the dataset is downloaded, you can import it into R. Because the downloaded data file is in the .rds format, you can navigate to the file either from within RStudio’s Files pane, or manually in Windows Explorer, and double-click the file to open. However, this is not a recommended way of opening a file, because you want to have a record of the action in your R script for the future.\nYou can load datasets saved in the .rds format using the readRDS() command. If your dataset is in another format, you can check out the {readr} package (for rectangular data such as .csv (comma separated values) or .tsv (tab separated values)), {readxl} (for Excel data), and {sjlabelled} (for SPSS, Stata and SAS formats).\nThe more generic function data_read() from {easystats}’s {datawizard} package loads data from various formats based on the source files extension, including files from internet sources or compressed files. It relies on the {rio} package, which provides similar functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that by default the data_read() function assumes that numeric variables where all values have a value label are categorical and will convert them into factors. That means that all the numeric “values” will be replaced by the “value labels” (e.g. 1=“Yes”/ 2=“No” will become simply “Yes”/“No”). This is usually a reasonable default behaviour, because the majority of functions in R do not handle “value labels” and working with textual (character string) values can be more explicit. However, this may be less appropriate when the dataset contains many long ordered variables (such as 0-10 scale items), as we will most likely want to treat such variables as numeric in statistical models. To cancel this default behaviour, we can add the additional argument convert_factors = FALSE. This is also the format that gets imported when using readRDS(). However, most of the common tabulation and graphing functions will not show the category “labels” in the output either, and for that purpose having variables “converted to factors” (with the original “Values” overwritten by the “Value labels”) may be a better option. Below we will import the data with factors converted, as we will focus on tabulation and plotting.\n\n\nIf you have saved the dataset into the same folder where your analysis script/Quarto file lives, you can import it by specifying just the name of the dataset. If it’s in a sub-folder or a different location on the computer, you need to include a full path to the dataset, like in the example below:\n\n\nCode\nwvs7data &lt;- readRDS(\"D:/HSS8005/MyData/wvs7.rds\")\n\n\nIn the code above, I am assigning (with the assignment operator &lt;-) the data to an object I called “wvs7data”, but I could have given it any other name as long as it follows R’s naming conventions (no spaces, avoid special characters; see also recommended naming strategies in the tidyverse style guide). The object will appear in the Environment tab (on the bottom right pane).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWorking with folders and paths\nIf the data file is not in the folder where you main script (the one that does the importing) is, you will need to specify either a relative path from the script to the data file, or an absolute path from the home/working directory.\nCopy/pasting paths on Windows computers\nAn easy way to get the path to the data file is to navigate there on your computer, copy the path, and paste it into your R script. However, there are some complications with this procedure when using a Windows PC. My path above would have copied as D:\\HSS8005\\MyData\\wvs7.rds, but R does not recognise back-slashes as path elements because in R the backslash has a special meaning. You must manually replace backslashes with either forward slashes or double-backslashes (D:\\\\HSS8005\\\\MyData\\\\wvs7.rds).\nAnother option is to use the function readClipboard(), which pastes into R whatever text you have on your clipboard (after copying it) using double backslashes. For example, you can copy a path to the folder where the data is located, then add the filename to the end of the text string using the paste0() function to get a working path to the file you want to load.\nYou can check:\n\n\nCode\n# First, copy the path to your data folder on your computer\n# Check the output:\n\npaste0(readClipboard(), \"/wvs7.rds\")\n\n\nThe file in the path can then be imported as normal:\n\n\nCode\nwvs7data &lt;- data_read(paste0(readClipboard(), \"/wvs7.rds\"))\n\n\nUsing the {here} package\nWorking with paths, folders, directories in a sustainable and robust way can be a challenge. The {here} package provides some useful options if you are working within R project directories. By loading the here library, you establish the working directory to be the root folder of your R project (i.e. the folder where the .Rproj file is located), and you can easily construct paths to any file within that project by listing the folders that contain it relative to the project root. This works similarly on all operating systems, and it’s as easy as:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(here)\n\nwvs7data &lt;- readRDS(here(\"HSS8005\", \"MyData\", \"wvs7.rds\"))\n\n\nYou can read more about the package in the “R for Social Scientists” course.\n\n\nWe can look at the dataset object in the Environment pane. If we click on the blue button with the white arrow before the name of the object, a list of variables and other information about them will roll down. If we click on the object’s name or info, the dataset will open in the Sources pane, just next to the R script file. This is equivalent to having run the following command:\n\n\nCode\nView(wvs7data)    \n\n\nNote the capital “V”; R is case-sensitive, so always pay attention; view(wvs7data) won’t work.\nYou can explore the dataset a bit. Only the first 50 columns (i.e. variables) are displayed, to see the next 50 you can click on arrow (&gt;) in the dataset window’s toolbar. Once you’ve had a quick look, you can close that view or return to the R script."

This is equivalent to having run the following command:\n\n\nCode\nView(wvs7data)    \n\n\nNote the capital “V”; R is case-sensitive, so always pay attention; view(wvs7data) won’t work.\nYou can explore the dataset a bit. Only the first 50 columns (i.e. variables) are displayed, to see the next 50 you can click on arrow (&gt;) in the dataset window’s toolbar. Once you’ve had a quick look, you can close that view or return to the R script."

    "text": "Description\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003, 127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020, 264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\nReadings\nStatistics\n\nROS: Chapters 13-15\nConnelly, Roxanne, Vernon Gayle, and Paul S.

The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the module plan page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight lectures (1.5 hours each) and eight IT labs (1.5 hours) . The course stands on three pillars: application, reproducibility and computation.\nApplication: we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.\nReproducibility: developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and collaborative scientific research. We enforce the ideas and procedures of reproducible research both through replicating published research (see above) and in our practice (in the IT labs and the assignment). For an overview of why it’s important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools used in this module, read Chapter 3 of TSD (see Resources&gt;Readings). It’s also worth reading through Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science, although there are now better software options than those discussed there. In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow: the  statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect – the {tidyverse} – via the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n IDE for data analysis, and  for scientific writing and publishing (see Resources&gt;Software).\nComputation: the development of computational methods underpins the application of the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (see Andrew Gelman’s article on these developments here or an online workshop talk here; Richard McElreath’s great talk on Science as Amateur Software Development is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in a textbook such as OpenIntro Statistics (you can download it for free).\nThose who don’t feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and read/practice beyond the compulsory material during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up.\nThose with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.\nNo previous knowledge of  or command-based statistical analysis software is needed. Gaining experience with using statistical software is part of the skills development aims of the module. However, it is not a general data science module, and the IT labs will cover a very limited number of functions (from both base , the tidyverse and other reliable user-written packages) that are most useful for tackling specific analysis tasks. Students are advised to complete some additional self-paced free online training in the use of the software, such as Data Carpentry’s R for Social Scientists, and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund’s R for Data Science) online book.\n\n\n\nThe course and the website were written and are maintained by Chris Moreh."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Description\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube.

This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. The Console is the direct interface to the R software itself; it’s what we get if instead of RStudio we open the R software: a direct interface to the R programming language, where we can type commands and where results/messages are printed.\nYou can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script. For this reason, we should not use the Console pane directly too much, ad reserve it only for quick and dirty calculations and checks. For typing commands that we want R to execute, we should instead use an R script file, where everything we type can be saved for later and complex analyses can be built up.\nThe Source Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to work with scripts and other text files. This pane is also where datasets (data frames) open up for viewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your RStudio displays only one pane on the left, it is because you have no scripts open yet. We can open an existing one or create a new one. We’ll do that a bit later.\n\n\nThe Environment Pane\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of “objects” that are available in an active session. Datasets loaded for analysis would appear here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf your Environment is empty, it means that you don’t have any “objects” loaded or created yet. We will be creating some objects later and we will also import an example dataset.\n\n\nFiles, Plots, Packages, Help, etc. The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can arrange the panes in various ways, depending on your preferences, using Tools &gt; Global Options in the top menu. So the arrangement of panes may look different on different computers.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral settings\nYou can personalise the look and feel of your RStudio setup in various ways using Tools &gt; Global Options from the top menu, but setting some options as default from the very start is highly recommended. You can see these in the pictures below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important setting in the picture on the left is the one to restore .RData at startup and saving the workspace as .RData on exit. Make sure these are un-ticked and set to ‘Never’, respectively, as shown in the picture. It’s always safer to start each RStudio session in a clean state, without anything automatically pre-loaded from a previous session. That could lead to serious and hard to trace complications.\nIn the picture on the right, you have the option to select that the new native pipe operator (|&gt;) (we’ll talk about it later!) be inserted using the Ctrl+Shift+M keyboard shortcut instead of the older version of the pipe (%&gt;%).\n\nThese settings will make more sense later, but it’s a good idea to have them sorted at the very beginning.\n\n\nScripts, markdown documents and projects\nWriting brief commands that you want to test out in the Console is okay, but what you really want is to save your commands as part of a workflow in a dedicated file that you can reuse, extend and share with others.\nIn every quantitative analysis, we need to ensure that each step in our analysis is traceable and reproducible. This is increasingly a professional standard expected of all data analysts in the social sciences. This means that we need to have an efficient way in which to share our analysis code, as well as our outputs and interpretations of our findings. RStudio has an efficient way of handling this requirement with the use of R script files and versions of the Markdown markup language that allow the efficient combining of plain text (as in the main body of an article) with analysis code and outputs produced in R. The table below lists the main characteristics of these file types:\n\n\n\nFormat\nExtension\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nR Script\n.R\nUse an R script if you want to document a large amount of code used for a particular analysis project. Scripts should contain working R commands and human-readable comments explaining the code. Commands can be run line-by-line, or the whole R script can be run at once. For example, one can write an R script containing a few hundred or thousands of lines of code that gathers and prepares raw, unruly data for analysis; if this script can run without any errors, then it can be saved and sourced from within another script that contains code that undertakes the analysis using the cleansed dataset. Comments can be added by appending them with a hashtag (#).\n\n\nR Markdown\n.Rmd\nMarkdown is a simple markup language that allows the formatting of plain text documents. R Markdown is a version of this language written by the R Studio team, which also allows for R code to be included. Plain text documents having the .Rmd extension and containing R Markdown-specific code can be “knitted” (exported) directly into published output document formats such as HTML, PDF or Microsoft Word, which contain both normal text as well as tables and charts produced with the embedded R code. The code itself can also be printed to the output documents.\n\n\nQuarto document\n.qmd\nQuarto is a newer version of R Markdown which allows better compatibility with other programming languages. It is a broader ecosystem design for academic publishing and communication (for example, the course website was built using quarto), but you will be using only Quarto documents in this module. There isn’t much difference between .Rmd and .qmd documents for their uses-cases on this module, so one could easily change and .Rmd extension to .qmd and still produce the same output. .qmd documents are “rendered” instead of “knitted”, but for RStudio users the underlying engine doing the conversion from Quarto/R Markdown to standard Markdown to output file (HTML, PDF, Word, etc.) is the same. Read more about Quarto document in the TSD textbook.\n\n\n\nCreating new files can be done easily via the options File &gt; New File &gt; from the top RStudio menu.\nThe best way to use these files are as part of R project folders, which allow for cross-references to documents and datasets to be made relative to the path of the project folder root. This makes sure that no absolute paths to files (i.e. things like “C:/Documents/Chris/my_article/data_files/my_dataset.rds”) need to be used (instead, you would write something like “~/data_files/my_dataset.rds” if the “my_article” folder was set up as an R Project). This allows for the same code file to be run on another computer too without an error, ensuring a minimal expected level of reproducibility in your workflow.\nSetting up an existing or a new folder as an R Project involves having a file with the extension .RProj saved in it. This can be done easily via the options File &gt; New Project from the top RStudio menu.",

    "text": "Data frames\nIt is useful to know about vectors, but we will use them primarily as part of larger data frames. Data frames are objects that contain several vectors of similar length. In a data frame each column is a variable and each row is a case. They look like spreadsheets containing data.\nThere are several toy data frames built into R, and we can have a look at one to see how it looks like. You can get a list of the available built-in datasets and their brief descriptions with the data() command.\nFor example, the mtcars data frame is built into R and so you can access it without loading any files. To get the dimensions, you can use dim(), nrow(), and ncol().\n\n\nCode\ndim(mtcars)\n\n\n[1] 32 11\n\n\nCode\nnrow(mtcars)\n\n\n[1] 32\n\n\nCode\nncol(mtcars)\n\n\n[1] 11\n\n\nWe can also load the dataset into our Environment and look at it manually:\n\n\nCode\nmtcars &lt;- mtcars\n\n\nThe new object has appeared in the Environment under a new section called Data.

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nInstead of programming your own functions in the R language, you can rely on functions written by other people and bundled within a package that performs some set task. There are a large number of reliable, tested and oft-used packages containing functions that are particularly useful for social scientists.\nSome particularly useful packages: - the tidyverse bundle of packages, which includes the dplyr package (for data manipulation) and additional R packages for reading in (readr), transforming (tidyr) and visualizing (ggplot2) datasets. - to import datasets in non-native formats and to manage attached labels (a concept familiar from other statistical packages but foreign to R), load the sjlabelled package (an alternative to haven and labelled, which work in a similar way but provide less functionality) - the sjmisc package contains very useful functions for undertaking data transformations on labelled variables (recoding, grouping, missing values, etc); also has some useful tabulation functions - the sjPlot package contains functions for graphing and tabulating results from regression models\nPackages are often available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or private repositories such as Bioconductor, GitHub etc. Packages made available on CRAN can be installed using the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). Once the package/library is installed (i.e. it is sitting somewhere on your computer), we then need to load it to the current R session using the command library(packagename).\nSo using a package/library is a two-stage process. We:\n\nInstall the package/library onto your computer (from the internet)\nLoad the package/library into your current session using the library command.\n\nLet’s start by installing the ‘tidyverse’ package, and then load it:\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")  ## this command installs packages from CRAN; note the quotation marks around the package name\n\n\nYou can check the suite of packages that are loaded when you load the Tidyverse library using a command from the tidyverse itself:\n\n\nCode\ntidyverse_packages()\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhy do you think we got an error message when we tried to run the above command?\n\nBecause tidyverse_packages() is itself a function from the tidyverse, in order to use that function we need not only to install the tidyverse but also to make its functions available. In other words, we did not yet load the tidyverse for use in our R session, we only just installed it on our computers.\nIf we don’t want to load a package that we have downloaded - because maybe we only want to use a single function once and we don’t want to burden our computer’s memory, we can state explicitly which package the function is from in the following way:\n\n\nCode\ntidyverse::tidyverse_packages()  # Here we state the package followed by two colons, then followed by the function we want\n\n\nBut in many cases we do want to use several functions at various points in an analysis session, so it is usually useful to load the entire package or set of packages:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nNow we can use functions from that package without having to explicitly state the name of the package. We can still state the name explicitly, and that may be useful for readers of our code to understand what package a function come from. Also, it may happen that different packages have similarly named functions, and if all those packages are loaded, then the functions from a package loaded later will override that in the package loaded earlier. R will note in a comment whether any functions from a package are masked by another, so it’s worth paying attention to the comments and warnings printed by R when we load packages.\nThere are also convenience tools - e.g. the pacman package - that make it easier to load several packages at once, while at the same time downloading the package if it has not yet been downloaded on our computer.\nFor example, we can download a number of packages with the command below:\n\n\nCode\n# Install 'pacman' if not yet installed:\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\") \n\n\nLoading required package: pacman\n\n\nCode\n# Then load/install other packages using 'pacman':\n\npacman::p_load(\n  tidyverse,    # general data management tools ('dplyr', etc.)\n  easystats,\n  gtsummary,\n  ggformula\n  )\n\n\nThese are some useful packages that we will be using in this module. You can read more about the packages we have just installed here:\n\ntidyverse\neasystats\ngtsummary\nggformula",

    "section": "About the Tidyverse",
    "text": "About the Tidyverse\n\nData frames and ‘tibbles’\nThe Tidyverse is built around the basic concept that data in a table should have one observation per row, one variable per column, and only one value per cell. Once data is in this ‘tidy’ format, it can be transformed, visualized and modelled for an analysis.\nWhen using functions in the Tidyverse ecosystem, most data is returned as a tibble object. Tibbles are very similar to the data.frames (which are the basic types of object storing datasets in base R) and it is perfectly fine to use Tidyverse functions on a data.frame object. Just be aware that in most cases, the Tidyverse function will transform your data into a tibble. If you are unobservant, you won’t even notice a difference. However, there are a few differences between the two data types, most of which are just designed to make your life easier. For more info, check R4DS.\n\n\nSelected dplyr functions\nThe dplyr package is designed to make it easier to manipulate flat (2-D) data (i.e. the type of datasets we are most likely to use, which are laid out as in a standard spreadsheet, with rows referring to cases (observations; respondents) and columns referring to variables. dplyr provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code. Here are some of the most common functions in dplyr:\n\nfilter() chooses rows based on column values.\narrange() changes the order of the rows.\nselect() changes whether or not a column is included.\nrename() changes the name of columns.\nmutate()/transmute() changes the values of columns and creates new columns (variables)\nsummarise() compute statistical summaries (e.g., computing the mean or the sum)\ngroup_by() group data into rows with the same values\nungroup() remove grouping information from data frame.\ndistinct() remove duplicate rows.\n\nAll these functions work similarly as follows:\n\nThe first argument is a data frame/tibble\nThe subsequent arguments are comma separated list of unquoted variable names and the specification of what you want to do\nThe result is a new data frame\n\nFor more info, check R for Social Scientists\n\n\nThe forward-pipe (%&gt;%/|&gt;) workflow\nAll of the dplyr functions take a data frame or tibble as the first argument. Rather than forcing the user to either save intermediate objects or nest functions, dplyr provides the forward-pipe operator %&gt;% from the magrittr package. This operator allows us to combine multiple operations into a single sequential chain of actions. As of R 4.1.0 there is also a native pipe operator in R (|&gt;), and in RStudio one can set the shortcut to paste the new pipe operator instead (as we have done at the beginning of the lab). Going forward, we’ll use this version of the pipe operator for simplicity, but it’s likely that you will encounter the older version of the operator too in various scripts.\nLet’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a sequence of operations on data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h():\n\nTake x then\nUse x as an input to a function f() then\nUse the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then\nUse the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h()\n\nOne way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:\nh(g(f(x)))\nThis code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:\nx |&gt; \n  f() |&gt; \n  g() |&gt; \n  h()\nYou would read this sequence as:\n\nTake x then\nUse this output as the input to the next function f() then\nUse this output as the input to the next function g() then\nUse this output as the input to the next function h()\n\nSo while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. Instead of typing out the three strange characters of the operator, one can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + M (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + M (MacOS) to paste the operator.",

    "section": "Exercise 2: Import external data",
    "text": "Exercise 2: Import external data\nAs we have seen in Week 1, small datasets that are included in R packages (including base R) for demonstration purposes can be used by simply invoking the name of the dataset. For example, the command head(mtcars) would print out the first 5 rows (cases) in the “mtcars” dataset included in base R (more specifically, in its “datasets” package). To access a dataset from a non-base-R package, the process is similar, however, we need to ensure that the package is installed on our system and that we specify the name of the package; for example, to access the {starwars} dataset (which contains all sorts of information about the characters of Star Wars films), we need to make sure that dplyr - or the whole tidyverse - is installed:\n\nhead(starwars) # gives an Error\n\nhead(dplyr::starwars) # works, as long as {dplyr} or the whole {tidyverse} are installed\n\nReal-life datasets, however, need to be imported into R. Datasets come in various formats. R’s native data format has the extension .rds and can be imported with the readRDS() function. The counterpart function saveRDS() exports a dataset to the .rds format. The core-tidyverse {readr} package has similar functions (read_rds() / write_rds()).\nThe .rds format is useful because it can be compressed to various sizes to take up less space, but can only be directly opened in R. It is much more common to encounter data saved in a “delimited” text format, which can be easily opened in a spreadsheet viewer/editor such as Excel. This makes it very interchangeable and therefore very common. The most common is probably the “comma separated values” (.csv) format, which can be imported with the base-R function read.csv() or the tidyverse readr::read_csv() equivalent. Read Chapter 11 in R4DS for more on these functions.\nVery often, you will need to import data saved in the format of another proprietary statistical analysis package such as SPSS or Stata. Large survey projects usually make data available in these formats. The great advantage of these formats is that they can incorporate additional information about variables and the levels of categorical variables (e.g. value labels, specific values for different types of missing values). These additional information can be extremely valuable, but they are not handled straight-forwardly in text-based format, spreadsheets and R’s native data format. To make them operational in R, we need a few specially designed functions.\nThe {haven} package — part of the extended {tidyverse}, meaning that it is installed on your system as part of {tidyverse}, but the library(\"tidyverse\") command does not load it by default; it needs to be loaded explicitly — is one of the most commonly used for this purpose. Functions such as read_sas(), read_sav() and read_dta() import datasets specific to the SAS, SPSS and Stata programs, respectively.\nIt is highly recommended to read the documentation available for the {haven} package to understand how it operates. Fundamentally, it is designed to import data to a intermediary format which stores the additional labeling information in a special format that allows users to access them, but not making them easy to use directly. A suite of packages developed by Daniel Lüdecke from the University of Hamburg offer some additional functionality to work with labels directly when summarising and plotting data. These packages integrate well with the {tidyverse} and are actively maintained, and we will use them in this course to make our lives a bit easier.\nIn a previous step, we have installed and loaded the {sjlabelled} package and the easystats suite of packages, which includes the datawizard package that contains a number of functions that make data(frame) manipulations easier.\nThe functions sjlabelled::read_sas(), sjlabelled::read_spss() and sjlabelled::read_stata() are the {sjlabelled} equivalents of the {haven} functions mentioned above. This vignette article included with the package explains the main differences between the two.\nThe more generic function data_read() from easystats’s datawizard package loads data from various formats based on the source files extension, including files from internet sources or compressed files. It relies on the rio package, which provides similar functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that by default the data_read() function assumes that numeric variables where all values have a value label are categorical and will convert them into factors. That means that all the numeric “values” will be replaced by the “value labels” (e.g. 1=“Yes”/ 2=“No” will become simply “Yes”/“No”).\nThis is usually a reasonable default behaviour, because the majority of functions in R do not handle “value labels” and working with textual (character string) values can be more explicit.\nHowever, this may be less appropriate when the dataset contains many long ordered variables (such as 0-10 scale items), as we will most likely want to treat such variables as numeric in statistical models. To cancel this default behaviour, we can add the additional argument convert_factors = FALSE. This is also the format that gets imported when using readRDS().\nHowever, most of the common tabulation and graphing functions will not show the category “labels” in the output either, and for that purpose having variables “converted to factors” (with the original “Values” overwritten by the “Value labels”) may be a better option.\n\n\nAs a first step, let’s import the osterman dataset that underpins the Österman (2021) article (see the Data page on the course website for information about the datasets available in this course):\n\nosterman &lt;- datawizard::data_read(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005-data/osterman.dta\")",

    "section": "Exercise 4: Descriptive graphs",
    "text": "Exercise 4: Descriptive graphs\nCreate some basic descriptive graphs using the ggplot() command from the {ggplot2} tidyverse package for the association between the following variables:\n\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\n‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\n\n1. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’\nThe best way to approach this problem is by working through the first examples in Kieran Healy’s Data Visualization: A practical introduction, starting at Chapter 3, and applying them to your data. Outside class, you can develop these basic graphs into better looking ones by adding various extra layers. The ggplot() function is part of the ggplot2 package, which is included in the core tidyverse, so we don’t need to load it separately if we have already loaded the tidyverse.\nThe ggplot approach to graphs is to build them up step-by-step using various layers. The basic template code for a ggplot() graph is the following:\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;, mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;)) +  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;()\nFor example, the code below sets up a totally blank canvas:\n\nggplot()\n\nTo start populating the canvas we need to add a first layer containing our dataset and the variables we want to ‘map’ using the aes() argument (for “aesthetic mapping”). This adds coordinates to the canvas based on the variables we want to graph (in our case, ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’). We are treating ‘trustindex3’ as the outcome variables in these exercises, so we will want to position it on the y axis:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25))\n\nWe now have a basic layer, but no actual data. The final crucial move is to add another layer using the + operator the type of graph (called a “geom” in ggplot, short for “geometric object”, such as a bar, a line, a boxplot, histogram, etc.) that we want to use to represent the relationship between the two variables. In this case, given that both variables are measured on a numeric scale (or at least on an ordinal scale with seven or more categories), the best option is a scatterplot. In ggplot(), a scatterplot “geom” are called with the geom_point() function:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWe now have a scatterplot of the relationship between ‘trustindex3’ and ‘eduyrs25’. Because our scales are rather short and the data is spread out, this scatterplot is not very informative.\nWe can choose to add another “geom” that is better able to summarise the relationship. The function geom_jitter() (a shortcut to the specification geom_point(position = \"jitter\")) is helpful in such cases because it adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point, making areas of overlapping points more visible. The commands below do the same thing:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\")\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_jitter()\n\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter()\n\nAnother option is the geom_smooth() function, which provides a set of options, basically returning “smooth lines” representing various types of regression lines. The function fits a regression in the background and graphs the results. The default setting is to fit a generalized additive model that captures non-linearities in the data with a smoothing spline (the Wikipedia article on GAMs gives a maths-heavy outline of these models, but they are beyond our interests here). The smooth line produced is probably more informative about the general idea:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nBut we can also specify other regression methods, and because we are here aiming to model the relationship between trust and education as a linear model, we can specify the method as “lm”:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nNow we get a straight regression line, which is basically the visual representation of the bivariate linear regression model that we will fit in Exercise 2 below. There are numerous further specifications that can be added to improve the graph, and Kieran Healy’s book is a good resource for ideas that you can play around with. We won’t go into much more detail about these additional options here, but as a taster, let’s say that we want to make the regression line more pronounced by changing its colour to red and make the scatter dots slightly transparent by adjusting the colour’s “alpha” level:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = eduyrs25)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\n2. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’\nWe can now do something similar for the relationship between trust and age (the ‘trustindex3’ and ‘agea’ variables in the dataset). Again, both variables are measured on a numeric scale, so a scatterplot should work best. Because we don’t know what to expect and therefore what additional settings would improve each individual graph, we start from the most basic informative layer and build up from there. To practice some alternative approaches to working with plots, here we will first save the basic plot as a ggplot object, to which we can later add further layers and specifications:\n\nage_plot &lt;- ggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = agea)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nIf no output was generated from the command above, that’s as expected. The graph was produced, but we didn’t ask for it to be printed, we only asked for it to be saved as an object called “age_plot”. To see it, we can simply call “age_plot”. We can then make various additions to this plot.\n\nage_plot\n\nThis looks very similar to the previous graph, so we could add the same additional specificaitons as in the previous exercise, this time to the plot object that we saved:\n\nage_plot +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\nThe association between age and trust appears very weak, something that we will explore further in Exercise 2.\n3. ‘trustindex3’ and ‘female’\nWe can try a similar scatterplot here too, but there may be better options:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", colour = \"red\")\n\nThis graph can be confusing, are we are better off using another “geom” because the female variable is a dichotomous/binary factor (categorical) variable. A good visualisation tool in the this case is a boxplot, which can be called with the geom_boxplot() function:\n\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nThe issue with this graph is that the female variable, while a dichotomous/binary categorical variable, is not labelled; instead, the value 1 is taken to represent the “true” value for the name of the variable (i.e. 1 means that one is female, as the variable name states, and the value 0 means that they are not female, but male).\nWe could use the set_labels() function from the sjlabelled package to add labels to this variable:\n\nosterman &lt;- osterman |&gt; \n  sjlabelled::set_labels(female, labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"))\n\nThe sjlabelled package also has a special variable type - as_label() - which is useful for forcing R to use the labels of factor variables in outputs. In the command below, we first change the variable type with as_label(), then we run the same ggplot(_) function as before:\n\n# We are overwriting the original dataset here, so we better not make a mistake:\nosterman &lt;- osterman |&gt; mutate(female = sjlabelled::as_label(female))\n\n# And from now on the 'female' variable will be treated as a labelled factor:\nggplot(osterman, aes(y = trustindex3, x = female)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox-plots contain a lot of useful summary information about variables, and the interpretation of the shapes is the following:\n\n\nbox-plot",

    "text": "Exercise 5: Fit simple bivariate regression models using OLS\nFit three simple bivariate OLS regressions using the lm() function:\n\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘eduyrs25’ and interpret the results\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘agea’ and interpret the results\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘female’ and interpret the results\nRegress ‘trustindex3’ on all three predictors listed above and interpret the results\n\n1. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘eduyrs25’ and interpret the results\nWe will do just that, saving the regression as an object called “m1” (for model 1):\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25, data = osterman)\n\nThe model object has now been saved in the Environment, and we can inspect it manually if we want by opening it in the Source window. The object is a large list, with various components that we can call and print separately. The most basic information that we can obtain from the model is the coefficients:\n\ncoefficients(m1)\n\nThis basic information is enough to solve the linear equation underpinning the model:\n\\[ y_i=b_0+b_1x_i \\] The coefficients correspond to the \\(b\\)’s in this simple model, and we can plug the values in to obtain\n\\[ trust_i=3.91 + 0.11 \\times education_i \\]\nWe find, thus, that the number of years spent in education has a positive outcome on social trust, with each additional year of education associated with a 0.11-points higher score on the trust index, above the baseline of 3.91 points in the case when education is equal to 0. With this formula we can calculate predictions of the trust score for any individual \\(i\\) from their years of education.\nWe can also get more information about the model with the summary() function. When applied to a linear model object, it provides the following output:\n\nsummary(m1)\n\nThis output tells us a lot more about the fitted model, for example a summary table of the residuals and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) summary of the residuals, as well as estimates of variation for our coefficients (the standard errors and the p-values associated with t-tests - displayed as Pr(&gt;|t|)).\nWhile these are informative, the format is not ideal for further manipulation and presentation. Several user-written functions exist to improve on this output. For example, the {broom} package - part of the {tidymodels} suite of packages - has functions to extract model information into “tidy” tibbles (data sets), which can then be further manipulated and plotted. This is especially useful when working with results from many models that would benefit from comparing in a standardised format.\nThe summary() function prints out a lot of information, but it’s not the best format if we wish to reuse the various statistical components for further analysis, and the presentation of the output could also be improved. The model_parameters() and the model_performance() functions from the parameters package part of easystats is a better option:\n\nmodel_parameters(m1) \n\nmodel_performance(m1)\n\nThe output table shows both 95% confidence intervals (CI) and the standard errors (SE), which can be easier to interpret (CI are calculated as Estimate +/- (1.96 x Std. Error); you can try it out in the Console, replacing in the numeric values).\nThe best approach is to graph the model results and present them in a figure, but that’s not very informative in the case of a simple model with only one predictor, so we can leave it for later.\n2. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘agea’ and interpret the results\nWe can do as above:\n\n# Write your own code; name the mode \"m2\"\n\n3. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on ‘female’ and interpret the results\n\n# Write your own code; name the model \"m3\"\n\n4. Regress ‘trustindex3’ on all three predictors listed above and interpret the results\nFinally we can fit a multiple linear model with several predictors:\n\n# Write your own code; name the model \"m4\"\n\nOne interesting finding from Model 4 is to notice how radically the statistical significance of the female variable changes compared to Model 3. The impact of gender is still very weak in real terms: compared to men of similar age and education level, women score 0.04 points higher on the trust scale; but this is still a stronger effect than in the simple bivariate model (where \\(b_1\\) was 0.008), and our confidence intervals are much narrower.\nIt’s worth noticing that the number of observations used in the two models is not the same, due to missing values in some variables. We could make the samples comparable by selecting out the sample of 68,211 included in Model 4, then refitting Model 3 on that sample only:\n\nsample &lt;- m4$model\n\nm3_new &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ female, data = sample)\n\nmodel_parameters(m3) \n\nWe see that this does not affect the overall picture.",

As part of this exercise, access data from Wave 10 of the survey (from this site: https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/) and perform the following tasks:\n\ndownload the dataset to the Rproject folder\nselect the variables required to recreate the data to fit the multiple regression model from the previous exercise\ncreate your version of the ‘trustindex3’ variable\nfit the models from Exercise 2 and compare the results.\n\nYou should already be familiar with the functions needed to complete each of these steps, but it may require some self-study. The most important missing information required to complete this exercise is to be found in the description on how the trustindex3 scale was computed:\n\nTo study generalized social trust, I am following the established approach of using a validated three-item scale (Reeskens and Hooghe 2008; Zmerli and Newton 2008). This scale consists of the classic trust question, an item on whether people try to be fair, and an item on whether people are helpful:  - ‘Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?’  - ‘Do you think that most people would try to take advantage of you if they got the chance, or would they try to be fair?’  - ‘Would you say that most of the time people try to be helpful or that they are mostly looking out for themselves?’  All of the items may be answered on a scale from 0 to 10 (where 10 represents the highest level of trust) and the scale is calculated as the mean of the three items. The three-item scale clearly improves measurement reliability and cross-country validity compared to using a single item, such as the classic trust question. … See the Supplementary material for additional information on the construction of the social trust scale (Section A.1), as well as for models using the classic single-item measure of trust (Section A.9).\n\n\n&lt;&lt; the end &gt;&gt;",

So there are 56 possible outcomes.\nThe formula nCr(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r elements from a set of n elements.\nIn the formula nCr(6+3-1, 3), n is 6+3-1 = 8, which represents the total number of elements in the set when considering all the possible outcomes from rolling three six-sided dice. The -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating dice rolls.\nr is 3, which represents the number of elements we want to choose (in this case, the number of dice rolls we want to consider in a combination).\nSo, nCr(6+3-1, 3) gives us the number of possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from a set of 8 possible outcomes (the 6 possible outcomes from each dice roll plus 2 duplicates). This is also known as the number of ways to choose 3 dice rolls out of 8 possible outcomes.\nThe result nCr(8, 3) = 56 means there are 56 possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from 8 possible outcomes.\n\n\nThe n in nCr(n, r) represents the total number of elements in the set from which we want to choose r elements.\nIn the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes. If we roll three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. However, because we don’t care about the order in which the dice land, we need to remove the duplicate combinations that would result from simply rearranging the order of the same three outcomes.\nTo account for duplicates, we consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n elements, where n is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from rolling three dice.\nTo calculate n, we can use the formula n = n + r - 1, where n is the total number of outcomes from rolling the dice (in this case, 6), and r is the number of dice we’re rolling (in this case, 3).\nSo in this case, n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.

In this case, the number of unique combinations is simply nCr(n, r).\nHowever, when elements can be repeated, the number of unique combinations is not simply nCr(n, r), because the same combination of elements can be formed by rearranging the same r elements in different orders.

If we roll three dice, we have r = 3 elements. And to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, where elements can be repeated, we use the formula n = n + r - 1, giving us n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.\nThis means that there are 8 unique combinations of dice rolls that can be formed from rolling three six-sided dice, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination.

    "text": "Description\nThis week we will return to some of the models we fit over the past two weeks and turn our attention to the right-hand side of the regression equations. We will explore interaction effects, which allow for the association between a predictor and an outcome to depend upon the value of another predictor. Understanding interaction effects - and the concept of conditioning more broadly - can help avoid serious misrepresentations and misunderstandings of our data. Some famous statistical “paradoxes” can highlight these dangers, and the lecture will build on these conceptual examples before moving on to questions of model-building. It is technically very simple to fit models with complex interactions, however, their interpretation can be very difficult. As with the logistic regression model we covered in Week 3, we will explore ways to present and visualise results from interaction models, which make their interpretation easier. Exploring interactions also allows us to begin thinking about causality and causal modelling, a topic that we will expand upon in Week 5.\n\n\nReadings\nStatistics\n\nROS: Chapters 10-12\n\nAdvanced statistics readings\n\nBrambor, T., W.

    "text": "Basic interactions\nTo continue on from the toy models that we fitted in Week 2, we may remember that we observed a change in the size of the effect and statistical significance of the gender variable (female) when also accounting for years of education and age. The two models compared as so:\n\nm_m &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25 + agea + female, data = osterman)\n\nm_b &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ female, data = m_m$model)\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(m_b, m_m)\n\nThe question arises whether the gender variable interacts with the other predictors, particularly with education as that is the main focus of the research. In other words, we may have reasons to assume that the linear effect of education may be different for males and females. We can interact predictor variables in regression models using the : and * operators. With :, we include in the regression model only the interaction term, but not the component variables (i.e. their main effects); to include the component variables as well, we need to add them in as usual with the + operator. To note that we should normally want to include both main effects and and the interaction effects in a regression model. With *, we include both the main effects and the interaction effects, so it provides a shortcut to using :, but it is often useful to combine the two in more complex interaction scenarios.\nIn the code below, we interact gender with both education and age, and the two commands have the same result:\n\nmxa &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ eduyrs25 + agea +female + female*eduyrs25 + female*agea, data = osterman)\n\nmxb &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ female*(eduyrs25 + agea), data = osterman)\n\n## Check that they are equivalent\n\nsjPlot::tab_model(mxa, mxb)\n\nWe find that both interaction terms (eduyrs25:female and agea:female) are statistically significant, which can tell us that there is an interaction that may be useful to include in the model. The greatest challenge is in interpreting results from interaction models, as the usual interpretation of the main effect terms no longer stands and the focus should be on the interaction terms instead. The best approach is to visualise the interactions using a graph, and there are various user-written functions that make this task easy. Just to keep it simple, we will use the plot_model() function from the {sjPlot} package.\nFirst, we can check the interaction between education and gender:\n\nsjPlot::plot_model(mxa, type = \"pred\", terms = c(\"eduyrs25\", \"female\"))\n\nThis visualization in now easier to interpret than the numerical output. We see a steeper line for females than for males and the lines cross each other at around 12 years of completed schooling. Years spent in education therefore have a stronger influence on social trust for females than for males after around 12 years (which is generally the length of compulsory education in most European countries from which the data is drawn). Among those with education below this level, we find that males have higher levels of social trust, but longer educational careers have a stronger impact for women.\nWe can check the same for the interaction of gender and age:\n\nsjPlot::plot_model(mxa, type = \"pred\", terms = c(\"agea\", \"female\"))\n\nThe general pattern is the same, however, the overlapping confidence intervals up until about the age of 53 tell us that the observed difference between the two genders may be due to random variation in our sample. The effect of this interaction is weaker and less reliable than the one with education, and unless we have a strong theoretically motivated reason to include it in our model, we may want to keep a simpler model without this interaction effect."

    "section": "Replicating Model 1",
    "text": "Replicating Model 1\nWith this basic understanding of interaction terms, we can now attempt to replicate Model 1 from the Osterman article. Based on the description provided in the article and the appended materials we can reconstruct the main components of their model as shown below. As a first step, run the command and compare our results to those presented in Model 1. Bear in mind that the effects most coefficients are not presented in the main table (see also the table’s footnotes and Appendix 4 in the Supplementary Materials). We also did not include any survey weights in our model and did not include any error corrections, which the author does; so the results will not be exactly the same.\nIn the footnotes to Table 3, the author tells us that in addition to what is reported in the table,\n\nAll models include reform FEs [Fixed Effects], a general quadratic birth year trend, and reform-specific trends for birth year (linear) and age (quadratic). Additional controls: foreign-born parents and ESS round dummies.\n\nThe version of the model summary presented in Table A.3 in the Appendix also includes the additional controls, but not the other terms.\nIn the main text, the author further explains some of the reasoning behind their modelling choices:\n\nOne dilemma for the design is that there has been a trend of increasing educational attainment throughout the studied time period, which means that the reform-windows of treated and non-treated cohorts will also pick up the effects of this trend. To counter this, [the list of covariates] includes a general quadratic birth year trend, reform-specific linear controls for birth year and reform-specific quadratic age trends. The quadratic terms are included to allow sufficient flexibility in absorbing possible non-linear trends of increasing education within the reform-window of seven treated and seven untreated birth year cohorts. … The reform-fixed effects are also essential because they imply that only the within-reform-window variation is used to estimate the effects and between-reform differences are factored out, such as pre-reform differences in social trust. (Österman 2021:221–22)\n\nBefore we fit the model, some of the concepts in the quotation need unpacking. A quadratic term is a second-degree polynomial term - put simply, it’s the square of the variable concerned. The quadratic of a variable such as \\(age\\) is therefore \\(age^2\\), or \\(age \\times age\\). In other words, it is like a variable’s “interaction” with itself. Because of this, there are several ways in which the quadratic terms to be included in a model can be specified:\n\nWe could create the quadratic terms as new variables, and include those in the model, as below:\n\n\n# First, load the original dataset\nosterman &lt;- sjlabelled::read_stata(\"https://cgmoreh.github.io/HSS8005/data/osterman.dta\")\n\n# Create new quadratic variables by multiplication with themselves and add them to the dataset, saving it as a new data object\nosterman2 &lt;- osterman |&gt; \n  mutate(agea_quad = agea*agea,        # quadratic age variable\n         yrbrn_quad = yrbrn*yrbrn)     # quadratic birth-year variable\n\n# We now have two additional variables in the dataset; we can fit the model using those:\nm1_prequad &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ reform1_7 + female + blgetmg_d +                         # main covariates reported in Table 3\n                   fbrneur + mbrneur + fnotbrneur + mnotbrneur + factor(essround) +     # additional controls for foreign-born parents and ESS Round dummies\n                   agea + yrbrn + agea_quad + yrbrn_quad +                              # general quadratic birth year trend and quadratic age\n                   factor(reform_id_num) +                                              # reform fixed effects dummies\n                   yrbrn:factor(reform_id_num) +                                        # reform-specific birth year trend\n                   agea:factor(reform_id_num) +  agea_quad:factor(reform_id_num),       # reform-specific quadratic age trend\n               data = osterman2)                                                        # the new expanded dataset\n\n\nWe can get the same results by creating the quadratic terms directly as part of the modelling function. The one thing we should keep in mind is that if we want to include standard mathematical operations within a formula function, we need to isolate or insulate the operation from R’s formula parsing code using the I() function, which returns the contents of I(...) “as.is”. The model formula would then be:\n\n\nm1_funquad &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ reform1_7 + female + blgetmg_d +                         # main covariates reported in Table 3\n                 fbrneur + mbrneur + fnotbrneur + mnotbrneur + factor(essround) +       # additional controls for foreign-born parents and ESS Round dummies\n                 agea + yrbrn + I(agea^2) + I(yrbrn^2) +                                # general quadratic birth year trend and quadratic age\n                 factor(reform_id_num) +                                                # reform fixed effects dummies\n                 yrbrn:factor(reform_id_num) +                                          # reform-specific birth year trend\n                 agea:factor(reform_id_num) +  I(agea^2):factor(reform_id_num),         # reform-specific quadratic age trend\n              data = osterman)                                                          # the original dataset\n\n\nIn the two previous options, the quadratic terms will be correlated with the original variables. To avoid this by relying on so-called orthogonal polynomials we should use the poly() function. We can also fit the same correlated polynomial model as the ones above by adding the raw = TRUE option to the poly() function. In the code below, we will fit the correlated version first, then the orthogonal version (This stackoverflow discussion explains in more detail the difference between the two options):\n\n\nm1_polyraw &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ reform1_7 + female + blgetmg_d + \n                 fbrneur + mbrneur + fnotbrneur + mnotbrneur + factor(essround) + \n                 poly(agea, 2, raw = TRUE) + poly(yrbrn, 2, raw = TRUE) +\n                 factor(reform_id_num) +           \n                 yrbrn:factor(reform_id_num) + \n                 agea:factor(reform_id_num) + poly(agea, 2, raw = TRUE):factor(reform_id_num),\n               data = osterman)\n\nm1_polyorth &lt;- lm(trustindex3 ~ reform1_7 + female + blgetmg_d + \n                 fbrneur + mbrneur + fnotbrneur + mnotbrneur + factor(essround) + \n                 poly(agea, 2) + poly(yrbrn, 2) +\n                 factor(reform_id_num) +           \n                 yrbrn:factor(reform_id_num) + \n                 agea:factor(reform_id_num) + poly(agea, 2):factor(reform_id_num),\n               data = osterman)\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that the Stata routine used by the author fitted correlated/raw coded polynomials, so the orthogonal version below is just for a comparison and we will not use it going forward. For a side-by-side overview comparison of the models we fitted so far, we could use a model summary tabulation function (e.g. sjPlot::tab_model(), which we have used before, or modelsummary::modelsummary(), stargazer::stargazer(), or jtools::export_summs(); you can read through the function documentation and test them out). Below we will use the modelsummary() function from modelsummary. The function takes a list() object as argument, and the list can include several models to be tabulated side-by-side. We can either build the list() object first and pass the object to modelsummary(), or we can build the list directly as part of the call to modelsummary(). We can also easily include more descriptive labels for the models that we want to tabulate within the lint() function, as we will do below:\n\n# First, install the package:\ninstall.packages(\"modelsummary\")\n\n# Second, we make a list of the models we want to summarise; we can even name them:\nmodels &lt;- list(\n  \"Pre-calculated quadratic\" = m1_prequad,\n  \"Within-function quadratic\" = m1_funquad,\n  \"poly() with raw coding\" = m1_polyraw,\n  \"poly() with default orthogonal coding\" = m1_polyorth\n)\n\n# modelsummary table with stars for p-values added, as in the published article\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(models, stars = TRUE)\n\nThe results from the modelsummary() are not shown here because it’s a long and ugly table, but it’s useful for perusing to compare the results across the different models. For a cleaner table showing only the results included in Table A.3 in the Appendix to Österman (2021), we can use the coef_map or the coef_omit option in modelsummary() and only include m1_funquad:\n\n# It's cleaner to first make a vector of the coefficients we wish to include; we can name the coefficients as they appear in Table A.3; note that we also leave out the Intercept, as in the published table:\ncoefs &lt;- c(\"reform1_7\" = \"Reform\",\n           \"female\" = \"Female\",\n           \"blgetmg_d\" = \"Ethnic minority\",\n           \"fbrneur\" = \"Foreign-born father, Europe\",\n           \"mbrneur\" = \"Foreign-born mother, Europe\",\n           \"fnotbrneur\" = \"Foreign-born father, outside Europe\",\n           \"mnotbrneur\" = \"Foreign-born mother, outside Europe\",\n           \"factor(essround)2\" = \"ESS Round 2\",\n           \"factor(essround)3\" = \"ESS Round 3\",\n           \"factor(essround)4\" = \"ESS Round 4\",\n           \"factor(essround)5\" = \"ESS Round 5\",\n           \"factor(essround)6\" = \"ESS Round 6\",\n           \"factor(essround)7\" = \"ESS Round 7\",\n           \"factor(essround)8\" = \"ESS Round 8\",\n           \"factor(essround)9\" = \"ESS Round 9\")\n\n# Then we pass the vector to coef_map to select the coefficients to print\nmodelsummary::modelsummary(list(\"M1\" = m1_funquad), stars = TRUE, coef_map = coefs)\n\nWe can compare our table to the published one to confirm that the results are very close, but that there are some inconsistencies that we will address later in Worksheet 6."
