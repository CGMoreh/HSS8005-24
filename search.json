The module aims to provide a broad applied introduction to more advanced methods in quantitative analysis for students from various disciplinary backgrounds. See the module plan page for details about the methods covered. The course content consists of eight lectures (1.5 hours each) and eight IT labs (1.5 hours) . The course stands on three pillars: application, reproducibility and computation.\nApplication: we will work with real data originating from large-scale representative surveys or published research, with the aim of applying methods to concrete research scenarios. IT lab exercises will involve reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. The aim is to see how methods have been used in practice in various disciplines and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable students to apply this knowledge to their own research questions. The data used in IT labs may be cleansed to allow focusing more on modelling tasks than on data wrangling, but exercises will address some of the more common data manipulation challenges and will cover essential functions. Data cleansing scripts will also be provided so that interested students can use them in their own work.\nReproducibility: developing a reproducible workflow that allows your future self or a reviewer of your work to understand your process of analysis and reproduce your results is essential for reliable and collaborative scientific research. We enforce the ideas and procedures of reproducible research both through replicating published research (see above) and in our practice (in the IT labs and the assignment). For an overview of why it’s important to develop a reproducible workflow early on in your research career and how to do it using (some) of the tools used in this module, read Chapter 3 of TSD (see Resources&gt;Readings). It’s also worth reading through Kieran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science, although there are now better software options than those discussed there. In this course, we will be using a suite of well-integrated free and open-source software to aid our reproducible workflow: the  statistical programming language and its currently most popular dialect – the {tidyverse} – via the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n IDE for data analysis, and  for scientific writing and publishing (see Resources&gt;Software).\nComputation: the development of computational methods underpins the application of the most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years (see Andrew Gelman’s article on these developments here or an online workshop talk here; Richard McElreath’s great talk on Science as Amateur Software Development is well worth watching too). This module aims to develop basic computational skills that allow the application of complex statistical models to practical scientific problems without advanced mathematical knowledge, and which lay the foundation on which students can then pursue further learning and research in computational humanities and social sciences.\n\nThe course and the website were written and are maintained by Chris Moreh.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nTo benefit the most from this module, students are expected to have a foundational level of knowledge in quantitative methods: a good understanding of data types and distributions, familiarity with inferential statistics, and some exposure to linear regression. This is roughly equivalent to the content covered in the Introductory stream of the module or a textbook such as OpenIntro Statistics (which you can download for free in PDF).\nThose who don’t feel completely up to date with linear regression but are determined to advance more quickly and read/practice beyond the compulsory material during weeks 1-3 are also encouraged to sign up.\nThose with a stronger background in multiple linear regression (e.g. students with undergraduate-level training in econometrics) will still benefit from weeks 1-3 as the approach we are taking is probably different from the one they are familiar with.\nNo previous knowledge of  or command-based statistical analysis software is needed. Gaining experience with using statistical software is part of the skills development aims of the module. However, it is not a general data science module, and the IT labs will cover a very limited number of functions (from both base R, the tidyverse and other reliable user-written packages) that are most useful for tackling specific analysis tasks. Students are advised to complete some additional self-paced free online training in the use of the software, such as Data Carpentry’s R for Social Scientists, and to consult Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund’s R for Data Science (2nd ed.) online book."

    "text": "ReadingsSoftwareTrainingHelpOther\n\n\n\nTextbooks\nThe course does not strictly follow the content of a textbook, but the expectation is that students will read as much as possible of the assigned chapters from the following books:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020. Regression and other stories. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ROS\n\n\nFree to download PDF version from the book’s website: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023. Telling Stories with Data. Chapman and Hall/CRC  TSD\n\n\nFree online book: https://tellingstorieswithdata.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, A., and Hill, J. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  ARM\n\n\nNote: ROS is the expanded and updated version of Part 1 (and some of Part 3) of this book. While everyone in the free world eagerly awaits the publication of ROS’s multilevel counterpart, we’ll use ARM as a reference work for the theory underpinning multilevel modelling.  Not freely available. Access it in print or online via the NU library\n\n\n\n\n\nRelatively large portions of text will be assigned for reading in each week from these books, referring to them by their acronyms. Don’t worry if you cannot read all the textbook content assigned in any given week! Those for whom the method covered by the assigned readings is new, will be able to refer back to them throughout the semester and beyond, reading thoroughly and completing the applied exercises. Those already familiar to some extent with the methods, should nonetheless read the text as a narrative and will discover hidden gems that will spectacularly improve their understanding and ability to interpret their statistical results.\n\n\nApplication\nIn the IT labs we will practice applying methods by reproducing small bits of published research, using the data and (critically) the modelling approaches used by the authors. To fully understand the context of these data and the methods used, you must read the original journal articles and the available supplementary materials provided alongside. These readings will be listed under each week’s outline (still work in progress!).\nThe articles come from a variety of different fields, so expect them to push you outside your disciplinary comfort zone. The point is to see how methods have been used in practice and learn how to reproduce (and potentially improve) those analyses. This will then enable you to apply this knowledge to your own research questions.\nWhen selecting the articles, the aim was to strike a fine balance between (a) the simplicity of the methods employed, (b) data and analytical transparency, and (c) the strength of the analysis. So don’t take them as examples of all-rounds best practice, but examples of research that gets published while being self-confident enough to open itself up for public scrutiny. Aim for this in your own research!\n\n\nTechnique\nThere will also be various readings relating more closely to the technicalities of coding in R and scientific writing, collaboration and communication in general. These readings will also be listed under each week’s outline as the semester progresses. The generic reading that students are advised to go through on their own is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel and Grolemund. 2022. R for Data Science (2nd ed.)  R4DS\n\n\nFree online book: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition\nFinally, there will also be recommended readings listed under certain weeks that help place methods, statistics and probability theory in a broader frame. These are useful readings for everyone, regardless of whether you will be applying quantitative analysis in your research or future work.\n\n\n\n\nRequired software\nWe will use a number of open-source software for data analysis and scientific writing. You need to install these on your personal computers to be able to work away from campus:\n\n\n\n\nR\n(programming language)\nEssential\nR needs to be installed even if we will only use it via the RStudio interface.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nRStudio\n(integrated development environment)\nEssential\nYou will need the free desktop version appropriate for your operating system. RStudio combines the R Console - the direct interface to R - with a number of other panels.\nInstall the latest version from here\n\n\n\nTidyverse\n(collection of R packages)\nEssential\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages that make the R language easier to use by introducing a more consistent grammar. It provides functions that are particularly useful for data manipulation and visualisation. It is the most common ‘dialect’ used among social scientists.\nInstall from within RStudio by executing in the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\nQuarto\n(scientific publishing system)\nEssential\nWe will be using Quarto markdown documents (.qmd) throughout the course to document our data analysis. .qmd files extend the plain-text Markdown mark-up language (.md) to allow for data analysis code to be executed and results presented alongside the main text. This is an essential requirement for analytical transparency, reliability and reproducibility.The assignment will also be completed in .qmd.\nIncluded by default in the latest RStudio release; no need to install separately.\nYou can check your installation by executing in the RStudio Terminal :\nquarto check\n\n\n\nZotero\n(reference manager)\nRecommended\nIf you are not yet using a reference manager, I recommend giving Zotero a try. It will make your work much more efficient and it integrates (relatively well) with RMarkdown and Quarto using the the Better BibTeX add-on.\nInstall the latest version and add-ons from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with no previous experience using R and/or RStudio are advised to complete the self-paced free online training course R for Social Scientists provided by Data Carpentry at https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to get help with R outside class. If you encounter an error message or are looking for a function to perform a specific task that we have not covered in class, you can do a Google search; for best results, use the https://rseek.org/ search engine, which limits the results to those relating to the R language.\nYou can also search for answers on Stack Overflow, which is a popular help and discussion website for programmers. You can also post a question there, but make sure to follow community standards and advice on how to ask a good question and how to provide a minimal reproducible example. You will need some experience using the site before being able to ask a good question, but it’s more than certain that any quesiton you have at this stage will have an answer already somewhere.\n\n\nAny further study resources will be listed here."

    "text": "The number of possible outcomes when throwing three six-sided dice, without considering the order of the numbers, is nCr(6+3-1, 3), where nCr represents the number of combinations.\nIn this case, nCr(6+3-1, 3) = nCr(8, 3) = 56. So there are 56 possible outcomes.\nThe formula nCr(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r elements from a set of n elements.\nIn the formula nCr(6+3-1, 3), n is 6+3-1 = 8, which represents the total number of elements in the set when considering all the possible outcomes from rolling three six-sided dice. The -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating dice rolls.\nr is 3, which represents the number of elements we want to choose (in this case, the number of dice rolls we want to consider in a combination).\nSo, nCr(6+3-1, 3) gives us the number of possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from a set of 8 possible outcomes (the 6 possible outcomes from each dice roll plus 2 duplicates). This is also known as the number of ways to choose 3 dice rolls out of 8 possible outcomes.\nThe result nCr(8, 3) = 56 means there are 56 possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from 8 possible outcomes.\n\nThe n in nCr(n, r) represents the total number of elements in the set from which we want to choose r elements.\nIn the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes. If we roll three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. However, because we don’t care about the order in which the dice land, we need to remove the duplicate combinations that would result from simply rearranging the order of the same three outcomes.\nTo account for duplicates, we consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n elements, where n is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from rolling three dice.\nTo calculate n, we can use the formula n = n + r - 1, where n is the total number of outcomes from rolling the dice (in this case, 6), and r is the number of dice we’re rolling (in this case, 3).\nSo in this case, n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8. This means that we have 8 unique combinations of dice rolls, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. And the number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\nThe formula n = n + r - 1 is used to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, when the elements can be repeated.\nThe reasoning behind this formula is as follows:\nImagine you have n distinct elements, and you want to form combinations of r elements. In this case, the number of unique combinations is simply nCr(n, r).\nHowever, when elements can be repeated, the number of unique combinations is not simply nCr(n, r), because the same combination of elements can be formed by rearranging the same r elements in different orders. To account for this, we need to consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n + r - 1 elements, where n + r - 1 is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from the n elements.\nThe -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating elements, so we need to remove one duplicate combination that would result from simply rearranging the same r elements.\nSo in the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes, giving us n = 6 unique elements. If we roll three dice, we have r = 3 elements. And to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, where elements can be repeated, we use the formula n = n + r - 1, giving us n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.\nThis means that there are 8 unique combinations of dice rolls that can be formed from rolling three six-sided dice, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. The number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations using the combination formula nCr(m, r)\ncombinations &lt;- choose(m, r)\ncombinations\n\n[1] 56\n\n\nThis code returns the value 56, which is the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of m elements, where m = n + r - 1 and n is the number of unique elements and r is the number of elements to choose. This is the same result as we found earlier using nCr(8, 3).\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to m\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:m, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to n\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:n, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3"

    "text": "The number of possible outcomes when throwing three six-sided dice, without considering the order of the numbers, is nCr(6+3-1, 3), where nCr represents the number of combinations.\nIn this case, nCr(6+3-1, 3) = nCr(8, 3) = 56. So there are 56 possible outcomes.\nThe formula nCr(n, r) represents the number of combinations of r elements from a set of n elements.\nIn the formula nCr(6+3-1, 3), n is 6+3-1 = 8, which represents the total number of elements in the set when considering all the possible outcomes from rolling three six-sided dice. The -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating dice rolls.\nr is 3, which represents the number of elements we want to choose (in this case, the number of dice rolls we want to consider in a combination).\nSo, nCr(6+3-1, 3) gives us the number of possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from a set of 8 possible outcomes (the 6 possible outcomes from each dice roll plus 2 duplicates). This is also known as the number of ways to choose 3 dice rolls out of 8 possible outcomes.\nThe result nCr(8, 3) = 56 means there are 56 possible combinations of 3 dice rolls from 8 possible outcomes.\n\nThe n in nCr(n, r) represents the total number of elements in the set from which we want to choose r elements.\nIn the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes. If we roll three dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. However, because we don’t care about the order in which the dice land, we need to remove the duplicate combinations that would result from simply rearranging the order of the same three outcomes.\nTo account for duplicates, we consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n elements, where n is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from rolling three dice.\nTo calculate n, we can use the formula n = n + r - 1, where n is the total number of outcomes from rolling the dice (in this case, 6), and r is the number of dice we’re rolling (in this case, 3).\nSo in this case, n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8. This means that we have 8 unique combinations of dice rolls, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. And the number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\nThe formula n = n + r - 1 is used to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, when the elements can be repeated.\nThe reasoning behind this formula is as follows:\nImagine you have n distinct elements, and you want to form combinations of r elements. In this case, the number of unique combinations is simply nCr(n, r).\nHowever, when elements can be repeated, the number of unique combinations is not simply nCr(n, r), because the same combination of elements can be formed by rearranging the same r elements in different orders. To account for this, we need to consider the problem as choosing r elements from a set of n + r - 1 elements, where n + r - 1 is the total number of unique combinations that can be made from the n elements.\nThe -1 in the formula accounts for the fact that we’re considering repeating elements, so we need to remove one duplicate combination that would result from simply rearranging the same r elements.\nSo in the case of three six-sided dice, each dice has 6 possible outcomes, giving us n = 6 unique elements. If we roll three dice, we have r = 3 elements. And to find the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of n elements, where elements can be repeated, we use the formula n = n + r - 1, giving us n = 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.\nThis means that there are 8 unique combinations of dice rolls that can be formed from rolling three six-sided dice, and we can choose 3 dice rolls from this set to form a combination. The number of combinations of 3 dice rolls from this set of 8 unique combinations is nCr(8, 3) = 56.\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations using the combination formula nCr(m, r)\ncombinations &lt;- choose(m, r)\ncombinations\n\n[1] 56\n\n\nThis code returns the value 56, which is the number of unique combinations of r elements from a set of m elements, where m = n + r - 1 and n is the number of unique elements and r is the number of elements to choose. This is the same result as we found earlier using nCr(8, 3).\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Calculate the number of unique combinations using the formula n = n + r - 1\nm &lt;- n + r - 1\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to m\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:m, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n# Define the number of unique elements and the number of elements to choose\nn &lt;- 6\nr &lt;- 3\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of length r from 1 to n\nall_combinations &lt;- combn(1:n, r)\n\n# Convert the combinations to a matrix for easier manipulation\ncombination_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(all_combinations)\n\n# Find the unique rows in the combination matrix\nunique_combinations &lt;- unique(combination_matrix)\n\n# Count the number of unique combinations\nnum_unique_combinations &lt;- nrow(unique_combinations)\nnum_unique_combinations\n\n[1] 3"

    "text": "Title\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nReading Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGamblers, God, Guinness and peas\n\n\nIn the first contribution to a series of articles on the history of probability and statistics in the journal Biometrika, Florence Nightingale David (1955) (no linear relationship with the famous social reformer) paraphrased a contemporary archaeologist who quipped that “a symptom of decadence in a civilization is when men become interested in their own history”, giving the interest in his own discipline as proof of the validity of his statement. David, however, thought that this does not stand true also for scientists’ and statisticians’ own emerging interest in their disciplines. He was right, in that the critical examination of the intellectual development of statistics and probability theory that followed has improved the discipline by excavating ideas that had been buried by mainstream statistics, but he was also mistaken, in that this activity threw light on the decadence of mainstream statistical practice. In this lecture we will look back on the development of some basic statistical concepts and learn about the ideas and preoccupations that influenced them over the centuries. The aim of this overview is to build up essential intuition about the concepts and methods that we will learn later. Brains-on activities will include casting astragali, fighting Laplace’s Demon, tasting tea, and comparing peas in a pod. By the end, we will gain a clearer understanding of the limits of statistical analysis and the dangers of not acknowledging those limits.\nThe IT lab will provide a very hands-on practical introduction to the statistical software that will be used in the module.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nRevisiting Flatland\n\n\nIn Edwin Abbott’s 1884 novella, the inhabitants of Flatland are geometric shapes living in a two-dimensional world, incapable of imagining the existence of higher dimensions. A sphere passing through the plain of their world is a fascinating but incomprehensible event: Flatlanders can only see a dot becoming a circle, increasing in circumference, then shrinking back in size and disappearing. There are, in this universe, worlds with even more limited views, like the one-dimensional Lineland and the zero-dimensional Pointland. Any attempt to expand the perspective of their inhabitant(s) is doomed to failure. But as in any good adventure story, a chosen Flatland native embarks on a journey of discovery and revelation - and ostracism and imprisonment. The story is interpreted as an allegorical criticism of Victorian-age social structure, but can equally describe the limitations of inhabiting uncritically a methodological world in which all data are ‘normal’ and all relationships are linear. Moving beyond linearity and acquiring the statistical intuition needed to think in higher dimensions and perceive more complex relationships is indeed a matter of practice-induced revelation. It’s unlikely that we will reach statistical nirvana in this short course, but we’ll attempt to build some more substantial structures upon the arid plains of linear regression. We start by looking around in the Flat-, Line- and Point-lands of quantitative analysis. Incorrigible procrastinators may want to check out a full-length computer animated film version of Flatland on YouTube. Others may be better served by this brief TED-Ed animation.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nDear Prudence, Help! I may be cheating with my X\n\n\nMuch of what we do in quantitative data analysis is about examining relationships. We are often interested in proposing and testing models of relationships between two or more variables. Sometimes our variables cry out to us begging for help, and we turn into agony aunts and uncles to our data. Other times we must psychoanalyse our data to uncover hidden associations and interactions. This is not an easy task. Do it carelessly, and you may unwittingly cheat yourself and the readers of your research. This week we’ll build some intuition for detecting complex and uneasy relationships within the design matrix X - that promiscuous commune on the right-hand-side of our regression equations. We’ll expand on the linear additive models that we looked at in the previous week by considering interactions among our predictor variables, we’ll explore the possibilities and challenges of asking causal questions of observational data, and we’ll think about ways to avoid what evolutionary anthropologist Richard McElreath calls ‘causal salad’. We may get an uncomfortable feeling that we may have cheated with our Xs in the past, but we’ll look towards the future. By the way, Dear Prudence is Slate magazine’s advice column; I like the name because being prudent really is essential in data analysis and interpretation. If you’re done with the readings for this week, you may indulge in some Prudie advice on matters more serious than statistics.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nThe Y question\n\n\nIt wasn’t until the last quarter of the 20th century that a unified vision of statistical modelling emerged, allowing practitioners to see how the general linear model we have explored so far is only a specific case of a more general class of models. We could have had a fancy, memorable name for this class of models - as John Nelder, one of its inventors, acknowledged later in life (Senn 2003, 127) - but back then academics were not required to undertake marketing training on the tweetabilty-factor of the chosen names for their theories; so we ended up with “generalised linear models”. These models can be applied to explananda (“explained”, “response”, “outcome”, “dependent” etc. variables, our ys) whose possible values have certain constraints (such as being limited by a lower bound or constrained to discreet choices) that makes the parameters of the Gaussian (‘normal’) distribution inefficient in describing them. Instead, they follow some of the other “exponential distributions” (and not only the exponential: cf. Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020, 264)), of which the Poisson, gamma, beta, binomial and multinomial are probably the most common in human and social sciences research. Their “generalised linear modelling” involves mapping them unto a linear model using a so-called “link function”. We will explore what all of this means in practice and how it can be applied to data that we are interested in most in our respective fields of study.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nDo we live in a simulation?\n\n\nWe have known ever since science-fiction author Philip K. Dick’s memorable “Metz address” of 1977 that our world is a computer simulation. Of course, like some common-currency theories in the social sciences, this knowledge will never be truly verified. We won’t even attempt to get to the bottom of it in class; instead, we’ll practice some basic methods of computer simulation for statistical inference and for generating data that has some idealised characteristics. Such methods play an increasingly important role in computational statistics and are extremely useful for designing robust data collection and analysis plans. If you make a mistake in the code and end up in an infinite loop, but you’re afraid that stopping the process may cause the known universe to implode, you can watch Dick on YouTube while you wait. If something like this can happen to our data, who says it couldn’t happen to us?\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nChallenging hierarchies\n\n\nBy now we got a sense that every new thing we learn about turns out to be merely a specific case of a larger class of things. So, all the models we covered so far are specific, single-level, versions of multilevel models, in which our cases can be seen as clustered within larger entities. Sometimes they are part of several cross-cutting clusters and/or the clusters are themselves clustered. In general terms, we must acknowledge that there are dependencies in our data that may influence their behaviour. It turns out that data about humans living in societies look somewhat like humans living in societies. The importance of including information about hierarchical dependencies in our models is probably emphasised by no one else more than McElreath (2020, 15), who wants “to convince the reader of something that appears unreasonable: multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression. Papers that do not use multilevel models should have to justify not using a multilevel approach.” We will encounter some of the uses and challenges of multilevel modelling.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nThe unobserved\n\n\nThe unobserved sounds like the title of a promising horror film; if we have achieved our aims in the module so far, our horror should be ‘merely’ metaphysical by now (Kołakowski anyone? No? Okay, never mind). We have already had to deal with various aspects of latency in our analyses. At the most fundamental level, we speak about population parameters, but we never actually observe them; even a sample statistic can be a purely imaginary case that doesn’t occur in real life. We have discussed the effects of omitted variables, which are thus unobserved by our model, but which we may have access to in our data. And, of course, our most interesting measurements are likely to be proxies of some unobservable theoretical construct (Mulvin (2021) has recently published a wonderfully rich book about proxies in general). This week we pick up an earlier thread from week 4, where we thought about binary and ordered multinomial variables as discretised manifestations of some continuous ‘latent variable’. We expand on this idea by exploring simple and then more complex latent variable models (factor analysis, structural equation modelling), as a further generalisation of the hierarchical perspective introduced earlier. This gives us a few more tools to deal with our radical uncertainty. (n.b. missing data points are another challenge that could fall under this heading, and learning how to deal with them is extremely important; but “The missing” is too good a title not to deserve a high-budget, weak-storyline, full-on special effects sequel somewhere else)\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\nWords, words, mere words…\n\n\nAs researchers in humanities and the social sciences, we use words both as tools of analysis and as sources of data. Words, and more broadly, texts, are also increasingly important for quantitative research in an age of so-called ‘big data’, when the digital world is saturated with unstructured textual information. But the statistical inspection of text is neither new, nor restricted to the humanistic tail of the social sciences. For example, a documented interest in the statistical study of literary style for the purposes of attributing authorship dates back to the mid-1850s (see El-Shagi and Jung 2015); and investors can use textual data such as minutes from the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee’s deliberations to estimate future monetary policy decisions before they are actually taken (cf. Lord 1958). Methods for the collection and quantitative analysis of large-scale textual data are increasingly available, but their technical implementation is complex and requires efficient combination of humanistic subject knowledge and statistical expertise. Faced with words, one is understandably caught between Shakespeare’s Troilus and Wilde’s Dorian Gray. “Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart; th’ effect doth operate another way. … My love with words and errors still she feeds, but edifies another with her deeds” - believed the betrayed Troilus. “Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?” - pondered Dorian.\n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\nReferences\n\nDavid, F. N. 1955. “Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics i.
