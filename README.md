This repo stores the source code for the website of the module **HSS8005 - Quantitative analysis (Intermediate/advanced stream)** offered to postgraduate students within the Faculty of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Newcastle University (UK).

The design of the website was inspired by Matt Blackwell's [Gov 50](https://github.com/mattblackwell/gov50-f22-site) and Andrew Heiss's [Program Evaluation for Public Service](https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com).
